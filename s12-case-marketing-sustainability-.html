How much can the market grow in the future? This chapter focuses on one company that is a leader in sustainability, Seventh Generation, to address these questions and to gain detailed insight and perspective about sustainable marketing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p04">Seventh Generation (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/about">http://www.seventhgeneration.com/about</a>) is one of the first companies founded on sustainability principles and mission in the United States. It is a Burlington, Vermont–based privately held manufacturer and distributor of environmentally friendly household and personal care products. The company’s marketing vision and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing mix</a><span class="glossdef">A planned mix of the controllable elements of a product’s marketing plan commonly termed as the four Ps (product, price, place, and promotion).</span></span> known as the four Ps—product, price, promotion, and place—emanated from its founding principles and the ideals and aspirations of its founder, Jeffrey Hollender. Seventh Generation’s products are made using only natural, recycled, or renewable materials that use nontoxic ingredients and the company focuses all its operations to minimize its impact on the environment. Initially Seventh Generation started out as a small mail-order company. As of 2011, Seventh Generation was a $150 million brand selling products at eco-focused stores, such as Whole Foods, and also in the broader consumer market at outlets, such as Target and Walmart.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p05">At its core and driving its marketing plans is the company’s mission to enable consumers to make a positive difference for the planet and people’s health through everyday consumer choices. For Seventh Generation, this means providing consumers the opportunity to make a positive difference through their purchases of laundry detergent, paper towels, and other household products.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p06">Jeffrey Hollender was born in 1954 and raised in New York City. In many respects his social values and activism grew out of discontent growing up in a wealthy family on Park Avenue in the early 1960s. According to Hollender, “I grew up in ‘Mad Men.’ Everyone was smoking. Everyone was drinking, and I was encouraged to watch TV.” His parents had a beach house on Long Island, in Westhampton, New York, near which he would surf, a welcome escape. “I turned on all that in a pretty rebellious way,” he said.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_002">Laura Holsen, “An Environmentalist’s Latest Laundry List,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 23, 2011.</span> At age seventeen, Hollender left home and headed to Santa Barbara, California, where for a short time, he lived in his car. He protested the Vietnam War. He returned to New York City after about nine months, finished high school, and headed to Hampshire College, a nontraditional college in Massachusetts, in 1974.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p07">Hollender’s discontent first motivated him to break the rules and expectations of him in his own life and over time to try to change business and consumer practices. His marketing instincts and savvy might have come from his father, Alfred, an advertising executive with a prestigious New York City advertising firm. And his inclination toward the dramatic might have been from his mother, Lucille, a former actress.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p08">Hollender dropped out of college and began his business career in 1977 by developing a not-for-profit skills exchange program based in Toronto. The program was successful but had to be shut down as a result of Hollender’s personal failing to get a work permit. After spending time on his cousin’s ginseng farm in Vermont, he decided to go back and continue his entrepreneurial career in the education industry, but this time as a for-profit business in New York City. He created Network for Learning, with nontraditional classes such as “The Art of Flirting,” which quickly grew, attracting sixty thousand students and turned a profit by its second year. Mr. Hollender sold the business to a Warner Communications unit for more than $2 million in 1985.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_003">“Three Who Thrived after Early Gaffes,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 4, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703648304575212151578380586.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703648304575212151578380586.html</a>.</span> As a result, he became president of Warner Audio Publishing, a division of Warner Communications, a position he held through 1987.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p09">Following his tenure at Warner Audio Publishing, Hollender partnered with Vermont “eco-preneur” Alan Newman and acquired a small mail-order catalogue centered on energy conservation products known as Renew America.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_004">Jess McCuan, “It’s Not Easy Being Green,” <em class="emphasis">Inc. Magazine</em>, November 1, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20041101/seventh-generation.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20041101/seventh-generation.html</a>.</span> This business provided him with the opportunity to change the society he was discontented with and it eventually became Seventh Generation in 1988.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p10">The company’s beginning was not easy, and the partners soon split. But Jeffrey Hollender had passion and kept the company. His values and unique personality moved upfront in the company and dominated its marketing and branding. This helped to differentiate the company and its products in a very competitive market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p11">“Many of us who have businesses run them within our cultural restraints,” said Yoram Samets, an early investor in Seventh Generation who has known Hollender for two decades. “We compromise ourselves. Jeffrey has done the opposite.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s01_p12">Fast forward to 2010 and Hollender has served as the president, CEO, and “Chief Inspired Protagonist” of Seventh Generation, building the company to a $150 million brand and a leading authority on making a positive difference in the health of the people and planet through everyday choices. This included Seventh Generation being named the seventh most responsible brand in America in 2004 based on a study performed by Alloy Media + Marketing.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_005">Seventh Generation, <em class="emphasis">2007 Corporate Consciousness Report</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/files/assets/pdf/2007_SevGen_Corporate-Consciousness.pdf">http://www.seventhgeneration.com/files/assets/pdf/2007_SevGen_Corporate-Consciousness.pdf</a>.</span> The commitment to sustainability was what their products were about and throughout the company—from founding CEO to product ingredient sourcing through marketing and to the end of the product’s lifecycle. For Seventh Generation as a sustainable brand, the company seeks to have positive impact in the world and do it all transparently.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Seventh Generation derived its name from the Great Law of the Iroquois that states, “In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.” Seventh Generation strives to live up to that brand promise with a full line of household cleaning and personal care products—from laundry detergents to baby wipes that are safer for people and safer for the environment. This positioning is prevalent within the company and is at the very core of their business model and marketing approach.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p02">A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design, or a combination of these intended to identify the goods and services of one seller and to differentiate the seller from those of other sellers. Branding is about getting potential consumers to view a seller as the only one that provides a solution to their problem. A brand is an image in the consumer’s mind and one that must be constantly fulfilled to remain positive.</p>

Their market research studies also concluded that new moms, in particular, were more likely than others to purchase sustainable products for their new family to create a healthier home and planet.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_007">Romy Ribitzky, “Seventh Generation Embarks on First Ever National Ad Campaign,” Portfolio.com, February 11, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/NTEMPN">http://bit.ly/NTEMPN</a>.</span> The company’s marketing mix reflected a focus on the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">middle green</a><span class="glossdef">Representing about two-thirds of consumers, these people have good green intentions but are not dedicated to buying only green products and services.</span></span>” consumers and moms, particularly newer moms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p03">The <em class="emphasis">marketing mix</em>, also known as the four Ps of marketing, is the combination of product, price, place (distribution), and promotion. Marketers develop strategies around these four areas in marketing to enhance a company’s branding, sales, and profitability. The marketing mix forms the foundation for creating a sustainable marketing strategy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p04">The four Ps can contribute to a company’s positioning as focused on sustainability. If a product or service is competitive in terms of price, then a sustainability focus on product attributes, place, or promotion can give that product or service an advantage particularly among those consumers most interested in sustainability, such as super or middle green consumers. Sustainable marketing often requires creativity in marketing different than for traditional products, but at its core is truthfulness about the ecological and social impacts of products and services. The consumers that will be most attracted to sustainable products and services will also tend to be the most scrutinizing about ecological and social impacts and most interested in the truth and transparency.</p>

        <div class="section" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Product</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p01">There is significant competition in the household cleaning product industry. The industry is dominated by large brands, such as Procter &amp; Gamble. In this highly competitive market, Seventh Generation’s point of differentiation is that all their products are environmentally friendly, and sustainability is at the very core of the business, not an add-on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p02">Seventh Generation products include 100 percent recycled fiber paper towels, napkins, bathroom, and facial tissues; natural cleaning and laundry products; natural lotion baby wipes; diapers; training pants; organic cotton feminine hygiene products; and trash bags made from 55 percent to 80 percent recycled plastic. The company is committed to making products that are environmentally sustainable—from seed to shelf.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p03">In 2009, Seventh Generation developed a product scorecard to give consumers (and their product designers) an objective scoring system for comparing different materials and product formulations to foster sustainable decision making. This tool can help consumers balance concerns relating to human health, the environment, product performance, and cost.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p04">In terms of manufacturing, Seventh Generation does not own the facilities that produce their products. They partner with manufacturers across the United States, Canada, and Germany to produce their products for them. Through an extensive auditing process Seventh Generation monitors the manufacturers’ facilities’ electrical use, fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and discharge, hazardous and nonhazardous waste, and recycling to ensure they are meeting Seventh Generation’s sustainability expectations.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_009">Seventh Generation, <em class="emphasis">2009 Corporate Consciousness Report</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.7genreport.com">http://www.7genreport.com</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p05">The company’s business model relies on partnerships with suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and retailers over which they do not have full control, which creates both challenges and opportunities, especially for a company that is committed to practicing sustainability and radical transparency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p06">To compete effectively and to grow, however, Seventh Generation must be an innovator in the sustainability category and deliver on quality and product performance. The “green” consumer, particularly the middle green consumer, is not just looking for how well a company performs on sustainability criteria but desires a product that meets all their needs.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_s01_p01">Part of the product is packaging. Seventh Generation strives to create packaging that has a minimal impact on the environment. This includes reducing the amount of material used by concentrating liquid laundry products, offering refills (so far just for baby wipes, but they are working on expanding this), and redesigning the packaging to use less material. Seventh Generation favors recycled over virgin materials and prefers materials that can be composted or recycled back into the materials stream.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_s01_p02">In 2010, Seventh Generation undertook a major packaging initiative to reduce their postconsumer recycled (PCR) content. Previously at a 25 percent PCR content rate, they changed to have the majority of their plastic bottles contain at least 80 percent PCR content, a significant improvement.</p>

It was only then that I realized how crucial a handle is to my laundry detergent paradigm.

For more universal adoption of green products, manufacturers need to deliver fully on the same, if not better, consumer experience. This includes how well the products perform in their main purpose. For most of Seventh Generation’s products this means how well they clean and how easy they are to use and at what cost.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s02_p01">For consumers to purchase a product or service, the price of the product or service has to be lower than the value consumers derive from the product. For sustainable products with costs higher than traditional products, the additional cost and price for sustainability has to derive benefits commensurate with the additional cost for the consumer to purchase the product. Some of that value can be in the form of reduced energy use and its associated cost savings—for example, with the purchase of a hybrid car or more efficient laundry detergent—and some of the value can be psychological and emotional, such as knowing you are reducing your environmental footprint and contributing to sustainability.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">As Seventh Generation’s sales first began to grow, larger traditional brands began to notice. And several powerful mainstream marketers launched green household products, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>The Clorox Company introduced Green Works household cleaners, dish, and laundry products in 2008, spending $25 million in advertising in both 2008 and 2009 behind the introduction according to Kantar Media, which tracks advertising spending. Green Works, once a $100 million brand, fell to $60 million in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_021">Kari Lipshutz, “Once You Go Green, You’ll Probably Go Back,” <em class="emphasis">AdWeek</em>, April 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/once-you-go-green-you-ll-probably-go-back-130883">http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/once-you-go-green-you-ll-probably-go-back-130883</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>Church &amp; Dwight launched Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials household cleaners in 2008, putting a decidedly different twist on the concept with a mix-it-yourself line. The cleaning products only include the active ingredients and the consumer adds the water at home to the bottle. This unique delivery system provides a 25 percent lower cost and 80 percent reduction in packaging than conventional cleaners.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_022">“Arm &amp; Hammer’s New Cleaners Not Only Greener, They’re Cheaper,” EnviralMarketing.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.enviralmarketing.com/2008/10/22/arm-hammers-new-cleaners-not-only-greener-theyre-cheaper">http://www.enviralmarketing.com/2008/10/22/arm-hammers-new-cleaners-not-only-greener-theyre-cheaper</a>.</span>

</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">Jeffrey Hollender, commenting about the competition, said, “Competition is definitely a sign of our success especially in the face of categories that simply weren’t growing for our competition.” Over time, both SC Johnson’s Nature’s Source and Clorox’s Green Works failed to meet the sales goals set by the parent companies,<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_024">Jeffrey Hollender, in interview with author, August 14, 2011.</span> and Seventh Generation was able to maintain its market share while competitors were experiencing a flattening out in performance since their introductory years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p03">According to an analysis by Stephen Powers from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, “You see disproportionately negative impact from products like Green Works, out of the big blue-chip companies that have tried to layer a green offering on top of their conventional offering, and a relatively better performance from the niche players who remain independent.” Using data from the Nielsen Company, Bernstein looked at sales for nearly 4,300 items in twenty-two categories, such as cleaning spray, liquid soap, bathroom cleaners, and detergents. It studied monthly sales from March 2006 to March 2011, the most recent data available. (Nielsen’s data include mass market, grocery stores, and drugstores but exclude Walmart.) Bernstein found that the market shares of green products generally were down from their peak—especially those offered by the big consumer-products companies. But the market share of the independent brands, like Method and Seventh Generation, were starting to increase relative to the shares of traditional brands’ green products in categories where they compete.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_025">Jeffrey Hollender, in interview with author, August 14, 2011.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p04">There were several factors at play. The mainstream companies venturing into green territory approached it much like a traditional consumer packaged goods company. They spent big money on advertising and promotion to generate awareness and trial but after the second or third year pulled back to almost zero spending. In contrast, Seventh Generation had over two decades to build its brand. But there has to be more to it than that. Consumers may not be looking to buy just a green-looking brand from a large consumer packaged goods company but instead want to purchase green products from companies who are more substantively committed to sustainability and adhere to its principles with all their brands, not just one or two product lines. Again, this is Seventh Generation’s primary competitive advantage and it was working for them but not enough to grow as large as their founder desired.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Seventh Generation Growing Pains</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">Seventh Generation declined in gross sales for the first time in a decade in 2009. The economic recession was a significant challenge for Seventh Generation as consumers tightened their budget and were more reluctant to pay a price premium for sustainable products. After averaging double-digit annual growth for ten years, the company’s gross sales declined by 2.8 percent. The company also lost consumer loyalty with a packaging change in 2009, which created less value for the consumer and did not adhere to their strict sustainability standards. Seventh Generation reduced the number of baby wipes in their packages without reducing the size of the package, decreasing the sustainability of the product (by increasing the packaging-to-product ratio 12 percent). When they did not adequately inform consumers of this change, consumers felt cheated and it weakened the authenticity of the brand and their trusted consumer relationship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">In the midst of the 2009 problems, Jeffrey Hollender self-selected his succession heir and hired a consumer packaged goods veteran, Chuck Maniscalco, as CEO to help position the company for greater scale and long-term growth.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_026">“Big Changes at Seventh Generation,” <em class="emphasis">7Gen</em> (blog), June 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/learn/blog/big-changes-seventh-generation">http://www.seventhgeneration.com/learn/blog/big-changes-seventh-generation</a>.</span> But in September 2009, Chuck Maniscalco resigned after a very short but difficult period in which it was hard for Hollender to reduce his influence on the company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p03">Then in October 2010, the board of directors voted to terminate Jeffrey Hollender’s employment relationship and began a new search for CEO.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_027">Marc Gunther, “Seventh Generation Sweeps Out Its Founder,” <em class="emphasis">Marc Gunther</em>, November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marcgunther.com/2010/11/01/seventh-generation-sweeps-out-its-founder">http://www.marcgunther.com/2010/11/01/seventh-generation-sweeps-out-its-founder</a>.</span> In February 2011, Seventh Generation hired a new CEO, John Replogle, who was previously president and CEO of Burt’s Bees.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_028">Alex Goldmark, “Seventh Generation Snags Burt’s Bees CEO to Replace Founder,” <em class="emphasis">Good Business</em> (blog), February 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.good.is/post/seventh-generation-gets-a-new-ceo-john-replogle-from-burt-s-bees">http://www.good.is/post/seventh-generation-gets-a-new-ceo-john-replogle-from-burt-s-bees</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes at Seventh Generation and for Its Founder</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p01">During his time at Seventh Generation, Jeffrey Hollender made the decision to bring on investors to help financially sustain the business. Hollender sold shares and created a board of directors, including his long time childhood friend, Peter Graham, the board chairman. It was an important move to help the company grow long term but resulted in him becoming a minority stakeholder. It’s not clear whether his childhood friend Graham backed Hollender in the power struggle at Seventh Generation or turned against him. Unfortunately, Hollender, after twenty-two years with Seventh Generation, found himself out from the very company that he began.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Hollender was shocked to say the least. He reflected on this change recently: “Seventh Generation was my identity, and getting fired was like having my identity stolen away from me. Most people couldn’t understand how I got thrown out of my own company. They didn’t know that as we raised more equity, I became a minority owner. After that, there were always tensions between social mission and making money.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_030">Issie Lapowsky, “What to Do When You’re Fired from the Company You Started,” <em class="emphasis">Inc. Magazine</em>, July/August 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201107/how-i-did-it-jeffrey-hollender-seventh-generation.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/201107/how-i-did-it-jeffrey-hollender-seventh-generation.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p03">In Graham’s letter to shareholders and employees, he said,</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p04">As the leader of the company since its very earliest days and its philosophical guiding light for over two decades, Jeffrey has been an integral part of our brand and an obvious lynch pin of our success, our unique corporate spirit, and our much acclaimed emphasis on equity and justice in the way we conduct our business. It is no overstatement to say that without his unwavering dedication to our cause and his tireless efforts on our company’s behalf, we would not be the company we are today, and indeed might not be here at all. His is a legacy worthy of the highest respect and admiration, and nothing in our recent decision should dim that in any way.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p05">Nevertheless, recent events have forced us to choose between divergent paths. We have elected to set the company on the one we strongly feel has the very best chance of fulfilling the commitment we’ve made to all our stakeholders to achieve the greatest possible lasting success, financially but especially in terms of making our world a better, safer place for our children and the following seven generations.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_031">Marc Gunther, “Seventh Generation Sweeps Out Its Founder,” <em class="emphasis">Marc Gunther</em>, November 1, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marcgunther.com/2010/11/01/seventh-generation-sweeps-out-its-founder">http://www.marcgunther.com/2010/11/01/seventh-generation-sweeps-out-its-founder</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Seventh Generation: The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p01">The new Seventh Generation CEO faced many challenges. The company needed to ramp up its marketing efforts to break through and get noticed in the middle green market and to increase the company’s brand awareness, which remained low. Also, among some of their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">super green</a><span class="glossdef">Consumers dedicated to buying products and services with commitment to the highest sustainability standards and practices. They represent about one in six consumers.</span></span> customers, effective marketing would be essential to reestablish consumer trust and interest in Seventh Generation after a difficult couple of years. All of this would likely require use of marketing mediums, such as television and the print media, with broader reach than special events, educational programs, and charitable programs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p02">To help marketing, Replogle created a new position of chief marketing officer (CMO) and hired Joey Bergstein, who hailed from Diageo, the world’s leading premium spirits company. Bergstein started his career with consumer packaged goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble and was senior vice president of global rum at Diageo where in five years he helped to double sales while growing Captain Morgan from a US product into a global brand with a strong international presence.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_033">Steve Ratti, “Seventh Generation Adds New Chief Marketing Officer,” <em class="emphasis">The Ratti Report</em>, August 18, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ratti-report.com/news-new-cmo/seventh-generation-adds-new-chief-marketing-officer">http://ratti-report.com/news-new-cmo/seventh-generation-adds-new-chief-marketing-officer</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p03">In marketing and other areas, it will not be easy to follow Seventh Generation’s founder Jeffrey Hollender. Replogle’s strengths are his leadership skills, demonstrated commitment to corporate responsibility, and a proven track record in his business career. Prior to being CEO of Burt’s Bees, Replogle spent three years at Unilever, where he managed the skin care division and helped to launch the Real Beauty campaign for Dove and establish the Dove Self-Esteem Fund for young girls. Prior to Unilever, he spent eight years with Diageo as president of Guinness Bass Import Company and managing director of Guinness Great Britain. He started his career at Boston Consulting Group after he earned an MBA from Harvard, from which he graduated with distinction. He received his undergraduate degree, a BA in government, from Dartmouth College where he currently serves as a trustee.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_034">“About John,” John Replogle for Dartmouth Trustee, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.john4dartmouth.com/p/about-john-replogle.html">http://www.john4dartmouth.com/p/about-john-replogle.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p04">According to Seventh Generation’s board chairman, Peter Graham, Replogle had been charged with “ensuring Seventh Generation’s untapped business potential is fully realized in the years ahead, both financially and in our continued efforts to make our world a safer place for our children and the next seven generations.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_035">Marc Gunther, “Seventh Generation’s New CEO,” <em class="emphasis">Marc Gunther</em>, February 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marcgunther.com/2011/02/13/seventh-generations-new-ceo-john-replogle">http://www.marcgunther.com/2011/02/13/seventh-generations-new-ceo-john-replogle</a>.</span> This would include how to grow Seventh Generation from a $150 million business. In order to do this, Replogle believed the company must innovate and refresh the tired worn out brand look making it more relevant to consumers. In a recent interview, Replogle said, “We are going to out-innovate the competition in terms of meeting consumers’ needs in an environmentally-friendly way.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_036">Marc Gunther, “Seventh Generation’s New CEO,” <em class="emphasis">Marc Gunther</em>, February 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marcgunther.com/2011/02/13/seventh-generations-new-ceo-john-replogle">http://www.marcgunther.com/2011/02/13/seventh-generations-new-ceo-john-replogle</a>.</span> With innovation, the company must ensure that its products fully deliver on consumers’ needs and provide a fair price and strong value proposition that neutralizes any green pricing gap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p05">What is not going to change according to company spokesperson, Dave Rappaport, senior director of corporate consciousness, is the company’s deep commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Rappaport, who was hired by Hollender after working in the nongovernmental organization world, stated, “Although the company was launched by Jeff’s vision, it is embraced by everyone here. It has been a part of everybody’s perception of his or her roles. Down to the innovations we’ve created on sustainability and corporate responsibility, you will find the work of employees who took the vision to heart.” He continued by stating that since letting Hollender go, the board of directors had approved the creation of a new committee on corporate social responsibility and sustainability. “With Jeffrey’s departure [they] know [they] have to institutionalize all of the things” he advocated for, making sure there is management oversight and “continued direct board oversight which there was through him when he was on the board.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn12_037">Alex Goldmark, “Hollender Speaks on What’s Next for Seventh Generation,” <em class="emphasis">Good Business</em> (blog), January 18, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.good.is/post/jeffrey-hollender-on-how-to-hold-seventh-generation-accountable">http://www.good.is/post/jeffrey-hollender-on-how-to-hold-seventh-generation-accountable</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p06">Inherent in the culture that Hollender built is radical transparency. So consumers will be watching. With the foundation that Hollender and his team created, the company could continue to be part of a trend, even a near revolution, to nurture the planet and the health of the next seven generations, or it could lose its market presence and relevance.</p>
