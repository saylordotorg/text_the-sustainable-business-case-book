        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_p01">There is significant and increasing interest and demand by both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumers</a><span class="glossdef">A person or group who purchases products or services for use or consumption and can also be called a customer.</span></span> and companies in being more sustainable. The sustainability market includes an increasingly wide range of companies, products, and services, all in some way intending to address sustainability concerns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_p02">Why do companies adopt sustainability principles? Sustainable practices are good business practices.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">Sustainable marketing is not just about taking steps to appear more environmentally friendly or more socially conscious and advertising that fact to consumers. It is more substantive and meaningful. Sustainable marketing draws on traditional marketing methods and in addition requires the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_l02">
            <li>Understanding of consumer’s values, emotions, and buying behavior related to sustainability</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the evolving sustainability marketplace</li>
            <li>Organizational commitment to sustainability and to positive relationships with their customers, communities, and the planet</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p01">An increasing number of consumers base their purchases in some way on the environmental and social impact of the product and services they buy and the companies from which they purchase. In an October 2011 study, Cone Communications and Echo Research identified that 81 percent of respondents said that companies had a responsibility to “address key social and environmental issues” and 76 percent of respondents said they had bought a product with “an environmental benefit” in the last twelve months.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_001">“2011 Cone/Echo Global CR Report,” Cone Communications, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.coneinc.com/2011globalcrreport">http://www.coneinc.com/2011globalcrreport</a>.</span></p>
