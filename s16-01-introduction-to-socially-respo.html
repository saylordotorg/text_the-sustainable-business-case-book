    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Socially responsible investing (SRI)</a><span class="glossdef">An investment strategy that considers the social value or merits of an investment in addition to its financial considerations.</span></span>—also known as sustainable investing—refers to investment strategies that seek to not only provide financial return but also be consistent with moral values and have positive societal impact. SRI can be as straightforward as an investor who avoids investing in any industry they find morally questionable—such as a tobacco manufacturer—to as complex as a billion-dollar fund that screens in or out many different types of investment opportunities based on key performance indicators in environmental and social areas.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p02">SRI recognizes that corporate responsibility and societal concerns are valid and important criteria for investment decisions. While SRI refers to a spectrum of investing activities, in general, SRI will be referred to as a broad-based approach that invests in companies that manage themselves in ways related to sustainability, including environmental protection and human rights. However, as mentioned previously, SRI can also be morally based and avoid so-called sin industries, such as those involved in alcohol, tobacco, gambling, animal testing, or weapons.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p03">SRI roots back to biblical times, as Jewish law provided specific guidance on ethical investment. In colonial times, Quaker and Methodist immigrants to the United States brought with them the concept of values-based investing exercised by their refusal to invest in slavery or war. In the 1700s, Methodist reverend John Wesley (1703–91) outlined his basic tenets of social investing—including not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries, such as tanning, because of their potential to harm the health of workers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p04">Modern SRI can trace its roots to the 1960s and 1970s in the United States as concerns over civil rights, the Vietnam War, gender equality, the environment, and nuclear power all emerged.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_002">“History of SRI,” SRI Conference, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sriintherockies.com/about/historyOfSRI.jsp">http://www.sriintherockies.com/about/historyOfSRI.jsp</a>.</span> Pax World Funds was created in 1971 as the first SRI mutual fund by Luther Tyson and Jack Corbett, both of whom worked for the United Methodist Church, for investors who did not want to invest in companies involved in the Vietnam War.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p05">SRI investment grew dramatically in the 1980s as significant societal events—for example, apartheid in South Africa, the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, and the oil spill in Alaska by the Exxon Valdez—led millions of people and organizations to invest in companies that were more socially and environmentally responsible. Other social phenomenon in the 1990s, such as Nike’s use of sweatshops, increased respect for indigenous populations, and tropical deforestation, further supported investment in SRI. By 1995, SRI had grown to fifty-five mutual funds with $12 billion in assets under management. Most recently, climate change has motivated new waves of SRI investment by both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">institutional investors</a><span class="glossdef">Organizations that pool large sums of money and invest those sums in securities, real property, and other investment assets. Examples include banks, insurance companies, college endowment funds, retirement or pension funds, and mutual funds.</span></span> and <strong class="emphasis bold">individual investors</strong>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p06">SRI mutual funds now span a wide range of investments opportunities, including domestic and international <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">securities</a><span class="glossdef">A fungible (interchangeable), tradable financial instrument representing financial value, such as stocks, bonds, or options.</span></span>. In addition to mutual funds, a growing number of financial products are becoming available that target SRI, including <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hedge funds</a><span class="glossdef">Investment funds that are flexible, can be illiquid and leveraged, and tend to be marketed to sophisticated high net worth individual investors and institutional investors.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exchange traded funds (ETFs)</a><span class="glossdef">Investment fund with features similar to a mutual fund, except that it is traded on an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p07">The performance of SRI funds has slowly convinced investors that there is not a significant trade-off—and there even may be some positive correlation—between social and financial performance. At the end of 2009, a review of 160 socially responsible mutual funds found that 65 percent of the funds had outperformed their benchmarks—funds with similar investment objectives.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_003">Jason M. Ribando and George Bonne, <em class="emphasis">A New Quality Factor: Finding Alpha with Asset4 ESG Data</em> (New York: Thomson Reuters, 2010).</span> Between 1995 and 2010, SRI had grown significantly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_p08">As of 2010, there were 250 mutual funds using SRI criteria in the United States, with assets of $316.1 billion.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_004">“Sustainable and Responsible Investing Facts,” USSIF, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ussif.org/resources/sriguide/srifacts.cfm">http://ussif.org/resources/sriguide/srifacts.cfm</a>.</span> These funds increasingly compete with traditional mutual funds and SRI-focused funds, such as Pax World Funds, and increasingly compete with the mutual funds industry giants, such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and T. Rowe Price, who have started SRI funds as part of their family of funds. Investors in the traditional funds are increasingly likely to move at least some of their assets to an SRI investment approach. How fast they do this and how much of their investments they direct to SRI funds and to mutual fund companies that only engage in SRI, such as Pax World, will depend on how important a sustainability- and moral values–based approach to personal financial investing becomes for households in the United States and in other nations and also on SRI fund performance and marketing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Mutual Fund Industry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">At the end of 2010, there were 7,581 <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mutual funds</a><span class="glossdef">Investment vehicles that are pools of funds that allow retail investors to invest with relatively low amounts.</span></span> in the United States with combined assets of $11.8 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a national trade association of investment companies in the United States. This is about 80 percent of the size of total US annual economic activity (gross domestic product) of $15 trillion. Worldwide assets invested in mutual funds totaled $24.7 trillion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Mutual funds are investment vehicles that are made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities, such as stocks and bonds. Anyone who invests in a mutual fund receives shares of the fund. Each share represents an interest in the fund’s total investments, often times called its investment portfolio. Portfolios include equity (ownership) shares in a large number of publically traded companies and bond holdings. Bonds are similar to loans and are issued by companies and public entities, such as cities and states, and purchased by mutual funds and other investors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p03">The value of mutual fund shares rise and fall depending on the performance of the underlying securities (stocks and bonds) in the portfolio. Similar to a shareholder in a corporation, an investor receives a proportional share of income and interest generated by the portfolio mutual fund units, or shares. Shares can typically be purchased or redeemed (sold) directly from the mutual fund company at the fund’s current <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">net asset value (NAV)</a><span class="glossdef">The value of a share of a mutual mutual fund that is based on the closing market prices of the underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio.</span></span> per share.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p04">In 2010, more than fifty-one million US households invested in mutual funds, or about 44 percent of all households. The median number of mutual funds owned by households was four and the median amount that fund-owning households invested in mutual funds was $100,000.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p05">Mutual funds have advantages compared to direct investing in individual securities, including increased diversification, daily liquidity, professional investment management, service and convenience, and ease of comparison. One of the main advantages of mutual funds is that they give diversification to investors with relatively modest amounts to invest. Disadvantages of mutual funds include management fees and less control over timing of recognition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital gains</a><span class="glossdef">A profit that results from investments into a capital asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, which exceeds the purchase price. It is the difference between a higher selling price and a lower purchase price, resulting in a financial gain for the investor.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital losses</a><span class="glossdef">Arises if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset are less than the purchase price.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p06">In the United States, all mutual funds are registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC was formed after the stock market crash of 1929 in response to abuses in the widely unregulated financial securities markets. Its mission is “to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_005">“The Investor’s Advocate: How the SEC Protects Investors, Maintains Market Integrity, and Facilitates Capital Formation,” US Securities and Exchange Commission, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml">http://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml</a>.</span> Under the 1940 Investment Company Act, which governs the mutual fund industry, a mutual fund consists of the shareholders and a board of directors (if organized as a corporation) or board of trustees (if organized as a trust) who are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fiduciaries</a><span class="glossdef">Someone who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances that give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence.</span></span> charged with acting in the best interests of the shareholders. A fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care. A fiduciary is expected to be extremely loyal to the persons to whom it owes some responsibility; the fiduciary must not put its personal interests before its duty and must not profit from his position as a fiduciary, unless the principal explicitly consents.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p07">The board of directors or trustees is charged with hiring a professional money manager or investment adviser to manage the assets of mutual fund. The fund manager, also known as the fund sponsor or fund management company, invests the mutual fund’s assets in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives. A fund manager must be a registered investment adviser. The fund manager’s responsibilities include portfolio management, legal compliance, operations, and marketing. Mutual fund managers generate revenue by charging investors fees, usually as a percentage of funds managed. These fees are called management fees. The fees normally vary from .3 percent to 1 percent of funds under management.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_006">“Socially Responsible Mutual Fund Charts: Financial Performance,” USSIF, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc">http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc</a>.</span> Multiple mutual funds that are managed by the same fund manager and that have the same brand name are known as a “fund family” or “fund complex.” The two largest mutual fund companies have total assets well above $1 trillion (see <a class="xref" href="#gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.1 "Five Largest Mutual Fund Companies by Assets under Management, November 30, 2009"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p01">The types of mutual funds vary according to a fund’s investment objective. A fund’s investment objective will usually seek capital gains (gains from the sale of portfolio securities), income (interest and dividends earned on the portfolio securities), or a combination of both. A mutual fund’s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prospectus</a><span class="glossdef">A document required by federal law to be provided to investors before investing in a mutual fund or other specific types of financial investments.

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Growth.</strong> A growth fund invests primarily in the common stock of well-established companies. This type of fund may invest for long-term capital gains.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Balanced.</strong> A balanced fund, as the name implies, invests for both growth and income. The fund will invest in both equity and debt securities.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Three Core Approaches in SRI<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_008">This is taken from “Sustainable and Responsible Investing Facts,” USSIF, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ussif.org/resources/sriguide/srifacts.cfm">http://ussif.org/resources/sriguide/srifacts.cfm</a>.</span>
</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p01">There are three core approaches in SRI. First, <strong class="emphasis bold">screening</strong> is the practice of evaluating investment portfolios or mutual funds based on social, environmental, and good corporate governance criteria. This includes both positive and negative screens. Positive screening, or “buy” indicators, involves including strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) performers, avoiding poor CSR performers, or otherwise incorporating CSR factors into the process of investment analysis and management. Generally, social investors seek to own profitable companies that make positive contributions to society. “Buy” lists may include enterprises with, for example, strong environmental practices, products that are safe and useful, and operations that respect human rights around the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p02">Conversely, many social investors avoid investing in companies whose products and business practices are harmful to individuals, communities, or the environment. This is a negative screen, or “don’t buy or sell” indicator. It is a common mistake to assume that SRI “screening” is simply exclusionary, or only involves negative screens. Positive SRI screens are being used more and more frequently to invest in companies that are leaders in adopting clean technologies and exceptional social and governance practices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p03">Second, <strong class="emphasis bold">shareholder advocacy</strong> involves socially responsible investors who take an active role to encourage corporations to improve their social and environmental practices. These efforts include talking (or “dialoguing”) with companies on issues related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Shareholder advocacy also frequently involves filing shareholder resolutions on such topics as corporate governance, climate change, political contributions, gender or racial discrimination, pollution, and labor practices. Shareholder resolutions are then presented for a vote to all owners of a corporation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p04">The process of dialogue and filing shareholder resolutions generates investor pressure on company management; often garners media attention; and educates the public on social, environmental, and labor issues. Such resolutions filed by SRI investors are aimed at improving company policies and practices, encouraging management to exercise good corporate citizenship, and promoting long-term shareholder value and financial performance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p05">Third, <strong class="emphasis bold">community investing</strong> directs capital from investors and lenders to communities that are underserved by traditional financial services institutions, such as banks. Community investing provides access to credit, equity, capital, and basic banking products that these communities would otherwise lack. In the United States and around the world, community investing makes it possible for local organizations to provide financial services to low-income individuals and to supply capital for small businesses and vital community services, such as affordable housing, child care, and health care. Community investing is the fastest growing area of SRI. From 2007 to 2010, community investing grew more than 60 percent, from $25 billion to $41.7 billion in assets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p06">Among the mutual fund companies that use an SRI-type approach, Pax World is commonly recognized as the third largest (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc">http://ussif.org/resources/mfpc</a>).<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn11_009">Because of the broad definition of socially responsible investing (SRI), it is difficult to do a standard accounting of all the funds that engage in SRI and SRI-like investing.</span> Parnassus Investments (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.parnassus.com">http://www.parnassus.com</a>), based in San Francisco, has about $6 billion in assets under management. Calvert, which includes both SRI and more traditional investing, has sustainability-focused funds of approximately $5 billion (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.calvert.com/sri.html">http://www.calvert.com/sri.html</a>). All the SRI funds, as with other investment funds, were larger in assets before the financial crisis of 2008–9. Pax World experienced nearly a 40 percent decline in assets under management during the sharp stock market decline.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p07">Smaller SRI funds have been consolidating over time. For example, Sentinel Funds (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sentinelinvestments.com">http://www.sentinelinvestments.com</a>) bought Citizens Funds in 2008. And further consolidation is expected as some of the big, traditional mutual fund firms enter the market and try to buy SRI mutual fund firms or consider launching their own suite of SRI-like products to compete with Pax World Investments and other SRI funds in response to increasing numbers of institutional and private investors asking for funds with social objectives.</p>

                    <li>Pax World helped start SRI and the sustainable investing industry by forming the first SRI mutual fund in 1971.</li>
                    <li>In starting the industry, investors had to be convinced that attention to social and environmental concerns had positive influence on company financial performance.</li>
                    <li>There is evidence to suggest a positive link between social and environmental performance and company financial performance.</li>
                    <li>Three core SRI strategies are screening (both positive and negative), shareholder advocacy, and community investing.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Discuss the spectrum of investing that is classified as socially responsible investing (SRI). Go to a company’s website and see what actions they take related to sustainability, such as environmental practices or water usage. After reviewing, does that change your view of the company? Are you more or less likely to invest in the company now?</li>
                    <li>In 2006, Parnassus Investments (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.parnassus.com">http://www.parnassus.com</a>) added an exclusionary screen to exclude investing in businesses involved with Sudan when the international community recognized the Darfur region conflict as genocide. Do you agree or disagree with these criteria for a SRI investment? What might be unintended consequences of a screen like this?</li>
