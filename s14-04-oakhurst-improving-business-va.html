Bennett purchased a dairy from the Leadbetter family in Portland, Maine, in 1921.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_027">J. Hemmerdinger, “Maine in a Bottle: Oakhurst Dairy Homogenizes Its Marketing Message,” <em class="emphasis">Portland (ME) Press Herald</em>, January 9, 2011, accessed January 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html">http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html</a>.</span> The grove, or hurst, of oak trees near the original dairy gave Stanley the idea for the name, Oakhurst Dairy. Sixty years later, about twenty-five dairies were operating in Portland. Today, only a few dairies remain in Portland and in New England, and the few that remain are the survivors of consolidation that has swept the dairy industry nationwide. The Bennetts have differentiated their company by making caring for the environment a core value and defining component of the Oakhurst brand. With a strategy of Maine-centric branding, operating efficiencies, and a deep commitment to the environment the company has carved out a market niche that has helped the small dairy processor survive against dairy processors and retailers many times larger.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_p03">As a member of the US Dairy Industry’s Sustainability Council, Bill Bennett was a contributor to two of the industry’s Innovation Center reports: (1) <em class="emphasis">US Dairy Sustainability Initiative: A Roadmap to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Increase Business Value</em> (December 2008) and (2) <em class="emphasis">The Sustainability Commitment Report</em> (December 2010). Bennett joined the Dairy Industry’s Sustainability Council as part that organization’s efforts to map, study, and recommend programs for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in the industry. Oakhurst Dairy was featured in two case studies illustrating carbon reduction best practices by the Innovation Center’s reports: (1) <em class="emphasis">Case Study—Solar Thermal Systems: Dairy Processor Carbon Reduction through Energy Efficiency (D-CREE)</em> and (2) <em class="emphasis">Oakhurst: Sustainability in Practice</em>.</p>

Approximately 90 percent of Oakhurst’s sales come from milk. Customers include large chains, such as Walmart and Market Basket, and small- to medium-sized independent grocery and convenience stores, foodservice outlets, schools, restaurants, and independent distributors. In addition to milk, Oakhurst sells branded cream, sour cream, cottage cheese, butter, ice cream, Portland mixes, juices, drinks, and water.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p02">Oakhurst spends more than $2 million annually on its advertising and promotion, featuring in its branding strategy “the natural goodness of Maine.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_028">Elaine Pofeldt, “Oakhurst Dairy,” Center for Small Business and the Environment, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf">http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf</a>.</span> According to dairy farmer Eddie Benson, “Oakhurst has helped to build a market for Maine milk.” He noted, “They have done a really good job of promoting Maine-grown products and marketing milk to people in Maine.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_029">J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Oakhurst’s sole manufacturing facility and primary warehouse are located at its headquarters in Portland. It owns three additional distribution facilities in Maine, one in New Hampshire, and one in Massachusetts. Every day approximately ten 7,500-gallon tanker trucks deliver raw milk to Oakhurst’s 65,000-square-foot processing plant in Portland, Maine. And every day between 130,000 and 150,000 gallons of milk are processed. The milk comes from eighty farms throughout Maine and northern New England. Many of these farms are family owned and operated and sell their milk exclusively to Oakhurst.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_032">J. Hemmerdinger, “Maine in a Bottle: Oakhurst Dairy Homogenizes Its Marketing Message,” <em class="emphasis">Portland (ME) Press Herald</em>, January 9, 2011, accessed January 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html">http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html</a>.</span> Oakhurst has been buying its milk from some of these farms for more than seventy-five years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">In 2010, Oakhurst processed approximately twenty-two million gallons of fluid milk per year in addition to other dairy products and beverages.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_033">Elaine Pofeldt, “Oakhurst Dairy,” Center for Small Business and the Environment, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf">http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf</a>.</span> At twenty-two million gallons of fluid milk per year, Oakhurst emits approximately a little under sixty-six million pounds, or thirty thousand metric tons, of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>e) annually. A metric ton is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds. Oakhurst used an estimated 27,500 million BTUs in milk production, packaging, and transporting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">Oakhurst samples the milk from each farm, each tanker is tested for antibiotics, and upon completion of the testing, the milk is off-loaded into raw milk storage silos. From the silos, the milk is piped to the processing area where it is separated to the proper level of butterfat. Fluid milk products are then homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified with vitamins. The product is piped into pasteurized tanks from which it is sent to filling machines in the packaging area. Cultured products like buttermilk or sour cream are standardized to the proper fat level and then sent to a cultured tank, where they are held until the culturing process is complete. After completion of the culturing process, the product is sent to another filler in the packaging area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">Eight packaging machines controlled by a computer system direct the products through a network of valves and stainless steel pipes so that each product gets to the proper filler at the right time. Each packaging machine fills a different size or style package. Quality testing is conducted every step of the way through the processing and packaging areas. Oakhurst was one of the first dairy processors to voluntarily adopt the most modern and rigorous set of federal quality standards known as HACCP (Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Points) and is one of only twelve dairies in the country currently implementing these exacting quality standards. After filling, each product is cased and moved to refrigerated warehouses where it is put away for storage until shipped to customers. In warehouse locations and on trucks, the temperature is constantly monitored to ensure the product’s quality.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_034">“Home Page,” Oakhurst Dairy, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.oakhurstdairy.com">http://www.oakhurstdairy.com</a>; J.

In addition to partnering with CA–CP, Oakhurst hired a sustainability consultant to work with the senior managers to examine Oakhurst’s social and environmental practices and to design organization change tactics to improve those practices. The consultant worked with the Bennett family to help transform and inspire employees to adopt and integrate sustainability practices into Oakhurst’s operational culture. As part of this effort, internal teams were established to help bring sustainability to the forefront of Oakhurst Dairy’s culture. These teams helped to establish and manage sustainability efforts including calculating carbon footprint, setting and tracking reductions, reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project and Maine’s governor’s challenge. As part of the continuing training program, Oakhurst hired another consultant to help them draft a code of ethics and respect in the workplace.</p>
