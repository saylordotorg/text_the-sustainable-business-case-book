    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">Kermit the frog may have had it right—“It’s not easy being green.” There is a lot to consider when creating a sustainable marketing strategy. It is not simply adding “green” to your brand platform or announcing that you support a worthy cause. To be most successful, a commitment to sustainability should be part of the company’s overall vision and an integral part of the company’s values and fundamental beliefs. For example, Seventh Generation, a Vermont-based company that makes personal and household cleaning products, adheres to a model of deeper business purpose (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch12#gittell_1.0-ch12">Chapter 8 "Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product"</a>). The company’s founder, Jeffrey Hollender, had a vision to create and nurture a company with sustainability at the core. Everything that the company does focuses on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit for the greater good. From their products—which are made using only natural, recycled, or renewable materials—to their philanthropic efforts that seek to help create a sustainable community, Seventh Generation employs a well-integrated sustainability vision and strategy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">A strong sustainability strategy includes understanding how the company impacts the people and environment in which it operates and consciously applies sustainable practices throughout <em class="emphasis">every</em> element of its business. Companies such as Timberland (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch10#gittell_1.0-ch10">Chapter 11 "Case: Accounting for Sustainability: How Does Timberland Do It and Why?"</a>) and Procter &amp; Gamble have adopted sustainability practices and have set specific and measureable goals—both short and longer term—to reduce their company’s carbon footprint. This includes actively examining the carbon lifecycle of their products—from the raw materials used in manufacturing all the way through to the recycling phase to ensure that they are meeting these goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">Inherent in this practice is the concept of radical transparency, whereby everything the company does is transparent and visible to the consumer and community at large, which contributes to the credibility of the sustainable brand. Measureable goals contribute to radical transparency as they provide clear and actionable goals to which the company can commit and progress against. For example, Unilever’s sustainable strategy commits to aggressively reducing their environmental impact and enhancing livelihoods by the year 2020. Unilever has made sustainability the cornerstone of their mission with clear, transparent goals against which they will be measured.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_005">“Unilever Sustainable Living Plan,” Unilever, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf">http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf</a>.</span></p>

Green marketing companies seek to go above and beyond traditional marketing by promoting environmental core values in the hope that consumers will associate these values with their company or brand.</span></span> plan focuses on the ideal marketing mix to achieve maximum profit potential while adhering to sustainability principles.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p06">The key elements of the marketing plan are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Corporate goals.</strong> These are the overall company goals that should be in line with the company’s vision and long-term strategic plan.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Objectives.</strong> Determine marketing objectives. Objectives should be stated clearly and should stem from the overall company’s vision and goals. Objectives should have specificity, such as to grow to 5 percent market share.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Strategies.</strong> After objectives are determined, strategies (which are how you are going to achieve the objectives) should be developed. An example is to convert all product ingredients to those that are locally sourced to help meet the objective of minimizing the company’s carbon footprint.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tactics.</strong> Tactics are the specific means or programs to achieve the strategies and this includes the four Ps (see the following). One example is identifying the local suppliers and costs to achieve a buy local strategy.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Market.</strong> Determine what market you are participating in and what stage your product or service is in its life cycle: development, introduction, growth, maturity, or decline (see the following sidebar titled “Product Life Cycle”). For green products especially, there may be opportunity to add a new dimension to a mature category with a new product benefit. For example, in the mature category of yogurt, Stonyfield Yogurt (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch13#gittell_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Case: Strategic Mission–Driven Sustainable Business: Stonyfield Yogurt"</a>) was able to breathe new life into the category when they first launched in 1984 with an organic product. Adding credibility to their sustainable brand was their “Profits for the Planet” program tactic, which commits 10 percent of annual profits to individuals and organizations working to restore and protect the environment.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consumer target audience.</strong> Identify who is your potential customer. In a study conducted by OgilvyEarth, there are varying degrees of how “green” consumers are. From die-hard “super greens” to “green rejecters,” marketers need to determine who best to target to achieve their marketing objectives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p07">There are several keys to creating an effective <em class="emphasis">green marketing strategy</em>:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_l03">
        <li>Understand the market and the underlying values and beliefs of your consumers and other key stakeholders, and develop a marketing plan that aligns well with these values and beliefs.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the products and services balance the needs of meeting consumer’s desires for quality, convenience, and affordability with sustainability goals.</li>
        <li>Be genuine and radically transparent throughout the marketing mix. In marketing communication and promotion efforts, actively engage consumers with issues that are meaningful to them, and listen to them. Give them a voice.</li>
        <li>Create alliances. Look for sustainable business partners, such as those from whom you source ingredients or other materials; nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that complement your business; and sustainable industry leaders and other like-minded businesses.</li>
        <li>Measure performance against key metrics and communicate progress. Radical transparency includes being able to share progress against sustainability goals with consumers and the community at large.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="simpara">Product Life Cycle</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p08">There are basically five stages of the product life cycle, including the development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stages. Customers will only be able to purchase products in the latter four stages because the product typically has not yet been placed on the market in the development stage. Some companies, however, like computer software companies, do release a limited number of products during the development phase to help with their beta testing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Sustainable Marketing Mix</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">The <em class="emphasis">marketing mix</em>, also known as the <strong class="emphasis bold">four Ps of marketing</strong>, is the combination of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product</a><span class="glossdef">A tangible good or intangible service that is marketed to a consumer.</span></span>, price, place (distribution), and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">promotion</a><span class="glossdef">The marketing communication tools and tactics that a company uses to promote and market their product, such as advertising, public relations, social media, personal selling, and event marketing, among others.</span></span>. Marketers develop strategies around these four areas in marketing to enhance branding, sales, and profitability. The marketing mix forms the foundation for creating a sustainable marketing strategy. Sustainability marketing, unlike traditional marketing, needs to adhere well to sustainability principles throughout the marketing mix. This helps to (1) strengthen the brand identity; (2) provide credibility; and (3) ensure honest, truthful communications and radical transparency with stakeholders, one of the cornerstones of good sustainability marketing principles.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">A <strong class="emphasis bold">product</strong> is a tangible good or an intangible service that is marketed to a consumer. A tangible good is something that can be seen, heard, tasted, felt, or seen. Products such as coffee, milk, biofuel, laundry detergent, and outdoor apparel are all examples of tangible goods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p02">Intangible products are mostly service based and provided by someone directly in contact with customers, such as mutual fund investment services, health care services, and consulting services. Sometimes the intangible service results in a tangible product, such as a lawyer providing legal advice in filing for a product patent. The intangible product is the lawyer’s services, and the tangible product is the patent itself.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p03">When looking at a sustainable-marketed product, consideration should be made for sourcing of materials, ingredients used, and the manufacturing of the product. This includes using all natural and organic materials, sourcing local and through fair trade suppliers, utilizing environmentally friendly materials, and using lean manufacturing and distribution methods that minimize the company’s carbon footprint. For example, Unilever (the corporate owner of Ben &amp; Jerry’s) has committed that all ingredients in Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream be sourced through fair trade suppliers and certified as such by 2013.</p>

The most successful companies in doing this sincerely embrace sustainability principles at its core; set clear and measurable goals; and clearly, transparently, and truthfully communicate with their stakeholders about the ecological and social impacts of their products and services.

Deriving its name from the Great Law of the Iroquois that states, “In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations,” Seventh Generation has long been practicing sustainability throughout its marketing mix for over twenty years. Their entire product line of household and personal care products—from laundry detergents to baby wipes—are carefully designed and manufactured to minimize their impact on the environment. Using all natural, renewable, and recyclable resources, Seventh Generation is working to “help protect human health and the environment.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_007">“Green Cleaning Products,” Seventh Generation, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com">http://www.seventhgeneration.com</a>.</span> (See <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch12#gittell_1.0-ch12">Chapter 8 "Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product"</a> for more information on their approach to sustainable marketing.)</p>

Products produced under the Earthkeepers label feature (1) reduced use of harmful chemicals, including no PVC and water-based adhesives; (2) use of recycled materials, including plastic bottles made into linings and laces and recycled rubber sole boots made with up to 30 percent recycled rubber; (3) use of organic materials, including organic cotton; and (4) use of recycled packaging materials, with all boxes made of 100 percent postconsumer recycled packaging cardboard. Timberland has implemented eco-labels to communicate information to consumers about the impacts of their products and has implemented life cycle management to quantify the environmental impacts of the products that it produces.

Since then, a hybrid engine train has been put into development, a state-of-the-art wind turbine blade has been manufactured, and a superefficient washing machine and coal-gasification technology have been introduced. General Electric, in particular, is noteworthy for its pledge to double its investments in the research and development of environmentally friendlier technologies. The total budget for research and development went from $700 million in 2004 to $1.5 billion in 2010.

Market segments should be formed in a way that differences between consumers within each segment are as small as possible. This is especially helpful to optimize marketing budgets, targeting dollars to those most interested in your product to allow a more effective and efficient marketing plan.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">Segmentation can be further defined using demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral segmentation. Demographic segmentation divides the market into groups based on variables, such as age, marital status, household income levels, education, children in household, and occupation. Geographic segmentation divides a market by location and includes such variables as population density (urban, suburban, and rural areas) and climate. Psychographic segmentation classifies consumers based on individual lifestyles, attitudes, and beliefs. Behavioral segmentation divides consumers by such variables as attitude toward the product, user status, or user rate.</p>

Once strictly limited to “tree huggers,” the market is growing. According to a 2011 study by OgilvyEarth titled “Mainstream Green,” consumers can be subdivided and segmented <em class="emphasis">behaviorally and psychographically</em> by their level of “green intensity.” Hardcore green consumers who only purchase sustainable products are called “super greens” and represent about 16 percent of the market. On the other extreme are “green rejecters,” those not looking for or interested in green products, which represent 18 percent of the market.

Since the introduction of the Toyota Prius in the United States in 2001, a growing number of vehicle models have been introduced with features that reduce environmental impacts. The Prius was the only model that provided a unique exterior shape and a design that stood out and announced that it was different than standard vehicles. The Prius has emerged as the clear leader among twenty-four different hybrid models available in the United States, with 48 percent of the 290,271 hybrid cars sold in the United States in 2009. Prius’s success is particularly pronounced in communities with high percentages of super greens, such as Berkeley (California), Boulder (Colorado), and Portland (Oregon), who want to make public their environmental practices and beliefs. The Prius with its unique product design has successfully provided the vehicle for owner’s to signal their affinity for the environment allowing super greens to make a conspicuous statement about their conservation efforts.</p>

Consumers have increasingly been made aware of environmental packaging choices and are changing their behavior as a result. A leading example of this is with water bottles. Many consumers have made the switch from purchasing single-use plastic water bottles to using refillable water containers. In 2008, 2.5 million tons of plastic bottles and jars were thrown away.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_014">“Use-and-Toss Bottle Facts,” Reuseit.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.reuseit.com/learn-more/top-facts/plastic-bottle-facts">http://www.reuseit.com/learn-more/top-facts/plastic-bottle-facts</a>.</span> The extremely slow decomposition rate of plastic bottles leaves them to sit in landfills or litter oceans for years. As a result of increased consumer awareness and consumer demand, sales of reusable water bottles from environmentally friendly producers such as Sigg and Kleen Kanteen have come onto the market. Consumers still want clean, filtered water, and companies, such as Brita and PŪR, makers of water filters, have seen a 22.2 percent and 15.2 percent increase in sales during 2009, respectively.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_015">GreenerDesign staff, “Green Product Trends: More Launches, More Sales,” GreenBiz.com, April 23, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/04/23/green-product-trends-more-launches-more-sales">http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/04/23/green-product-trends-more-launches-more-sales</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p03">Another one of the keys to sustainable packaging is to ensure that the product-to-packaging ratio is “right-sized”—meaning that the product tightly fits in the packaging and there is no wasted use of packaging materials or “air space.” This is not only for the package itself but also for the packing case, which houses multiples of the products for shipping. This is often referred to as “cube optimization.” Cube optimization means right-sizing packages and fitting orders into packaging dimensions that are as small as possible without threatening the integrity of the order. Tight packaging-to-product ratios accomplish two things: (1) they reduce use of packaging materials and (2) they reduce energy costs as the pallet loads are more condensed and the manufacturer is not paying to transport “air.” Additionally, as more and more products are being shipped globally in containers by ocean, air, trucks, and rail, every inch of transport space and fuel usage is significant. This is an example of a win-win situation for the business and the environment, as shipping more in the same volume of space cuts shipping costs, impacting the business bottom line, while reducing the amount of energy (and associated greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) needed, positively impacting the environmental “bottom line.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p04">Using renewably sourced materials is another way companies can create more sustainable packaging. Renewable materials are those that utilize forest, fiber, and agriculture products. Nonrenewable materials are those like plastic or Styrofoam, which are derived from petroleum and other fossil fuels.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Price</strong> is the monetary (or bartered) amount a consumer pays for a product or service based on the product or service’s value or worth. For sustainable products, pricing has often been an issue limiting a product’s or service’s mass acceptance and market growth. Green products tend to be more expensive because the ingredients may cost more than their conventional counterparts. For example, organic food grown with natural fertilizers may be more expensive than those foods not utilizing natural fertilizers. Manufacturing and transportation costs can also be higher. For example, if the transport costs use a higher cost but lower polluting renewable energy fuel source, this will contribute to a higher price point. This creates a price gap between conventional products and those that are sustainable, which is often referred to as the “green pricing gap.” The higher price can be a barrier to wide market acceptance for many green products, as some consumers may want to purchase products that are better for the environment but either do not want or are financially unable to pay a higher price. For the large majority of consumers, if they do not receive additional value from a sustainable product, for example, in the form of reduced energy costs or longer product lives, they will not pay a premium for the sustainable product. If a product is competitive in terms of price, as well as product, place, and promotion, with traditional products and services, sustainability can give that product a competitive edge particularly among consumers with some interest in sustainability such as the middle green.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03_p02">Marketers need to minimize the price barrier either by reducing the price point to be closer to its conventional counterparts or through marketing efforts to raise the perceived value to command a premium. Products, such as organic food brands, Earth’s Best, and Starbucks with their fair trade coffee, have done a commendable job in creating greater perceived value, thus commanding premium pricing. Some green product marketers use effective targeting to minimize the green price gap by targeting either people who are better off financially (those who can better afford to take environmental factors into their consumption decisions) or particular market or consumer groups, such as super greens and green regional markets (e.g., Portland, Oregon), with concentrations of potential customers who derive value in conspicuous conservation and demonstrating their environmentalism.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_019">Lindsay Kauffman, “Green as a Status Symbol: Why Increased Prices May Increase Sales,” Triplepundit.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/05/green-status-increase-prices-increase-sales">http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/05/green-status-increase-prices-increase-sales</a>.</span></p>

Their efforts included the first 100 percent recycled television advertising, reusing and remixing film from their previous campaigns over the years to create a new spot to introduce their Better World campaign. The digital mash-up showcases the inspiration and history of the brand while bringing attention to the sustainability concept of reuse and reducing resources. This is also a good example whereby utilizing sustainability principles actually benefits the bottom line. By reusing existing film, Nike did not have to spend the thousands of dollars to produce a new television commercial nor expend energy costs for a production shoot.

                <p class="para">FedEx recently launched a charming new ad campaign that highlights their sustainability initiatives. When consumers think of FedEx, sustainability doesn’t usually come first to mind, as it is a shipping and transportation business, which is a large user of fuel, not to mention paper products. But this new commercial highlights FedEx’s environmental efforts that help save forests and fuel and does so with Disney-esque charm. And when you strip away the Hollywood fairy tale dramatics, the spot reveals that FedEx is working hard at sustainable solutions for a better planet.</p>

The QR code directs consumers to a mobile-enabled website that shows a video portraying the company story and commitment to recycling, detailing how they use recycled sails to make their product. Future plans are to include bag tags (also made of recycled sails) with QR codes, which tell consumers their sail’s history and sailing journey around the world.</p>

It can be particularly useful for start-up ventures. It uses public relations (such as local press and media stories), blogs, social media, and community event planning and participation to drive qualified leads to company websites and physical locations for purchases.</li>

                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s05_p21">When Coca-Cola acquired Honest Tea, they began to approach the marketing plan the way the giant marketing behemoth always did—with plenty of national television advertising, deep trade promotion discounts, and slick shelf placement and promotion at retail. The traditional marketing efforts, which normally work well for a more traditional CPG brand, were a flop. Why? Because a big splashy marketing campaign was not in keeping with their “honest” brand image nor did it capitalize on the way that Honest Tea’s following had been built. Honest Tea’s success had been developed through grassroots marketing, which gave the brand an elite following that said, “We are not like everyone else—we require something special.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s05_p22">Their Honest Cities campaign worked particularly well; Honest Tea set up displays with bottles of tea with a one-dollar collection barrel next to the pallets—purchases on the honor system. They promoted Earth Day by handing out reusable shopping bags with each purchase of Honest Tea. The brand built its presence first in a local market then spread out to the region and then moved to the next local market; the brand then positioned itself to grow into the next region. In addition, the brand continued to focus on the health food chain channel like Whole Foods—not a stronghold for the traditional Coke beverages.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_026">Denise Harrison, “Honest Tea Teaches Coke a Lesson,” <em class="emphasis">Simplified Strategic Planning</em> (blog), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/?p=871">http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/?p=871</a>.</span> So when the big marketing campaign failed, what did Coke do? Coca-Cola went back to basics to effectively develop and implement a marketing plan that personified the brand image and even reprised the Honest Cities campaign, refreshed, of course, using pop-up stores called “The Honest Stand” and social media.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_027">Kyana Gordon, “Honest Tea Campaign Stimulates Sales Growth, Brand Awareness, and Honesty,” <em class="emphasis">PSFK</em>, March 9, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.psfk.com/2011/03/honest-tea-campaign-stimulates-sales-growth-brand-awareness-and-honesty.html">http://www.psfk.com/2011/03/honest-tea-campaign-stimulates-sales-growth-brand-awareness-and-honesty.html</a>.</span></p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s05_l10">
                    <li>A sustainable marketing strategy works best when it adapts and complements the overall corporate sustainability vision of the company, personifies the brand image, and is clearly and transparently executed throughout all marketing elements.</li>
                    <li>For an effective sustainable marketing approach, the four Ps, product, price, place, and promotion, should be based on sustainability principles and should align with overall marketing strategy.</li>
                    <li>Consumer target market segmentation is effective to better tailor marketing efforts to those consumer’s that align best as potential buyers or customers of a given product or service.</li>
                    <li>Physical products can be made more sustainable through considering ways to minimize materials use, minimize the negative impact of the production process, and maximize the efficiency of the distribution process.</li>
                    <li>Packaging changes, such as encouraging reusable bags, a tighter packaging-to-product ratio, or cube optimization, can be effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of a product while increasing profitability.</li>
                    <li>Sustainable goods can be more expensive to produce than conventional alternatives as a result of potentially higher-cost raw materials, methods of production, and renewable resources. This should be taken into consideration when developing the branding, developing the marketing mix, and focusing on a market segment.</li>
                    <li>A mix of promotional mediums is best to effectively and efficiently reach the target market with a consistent branded message and call to action.</li>

                    <li>Walmart is using their retail power to pressure their suppliers and vendors to help the company achieve its sustainability goals. How do you feel about this approach? Contrast it versus P&amp;G’s approach.</li>
                    <li>It has been viewed by some that Walmart’s sustainability efforts are a shallow public relations effort to help create a better corporate image, especially after much negative publicity that it is not substantive and meaningful. What do you think?</li>
                    <li>Provide an example of a product or service that adheres to sustainability principles and discuss the four Ps they use in the market. What is working well for them and what would you suggest for them to do to improve?</li>
