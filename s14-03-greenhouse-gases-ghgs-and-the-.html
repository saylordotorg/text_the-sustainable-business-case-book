The report was a collaborative effort of leaders and experts in and outside the industry who joined together to “identify and deploy sustainability innovations that make good business sense.” The report documented that the United States was the largest dairy producer in the world, producing annually 189.9 billion pounds of milk and that milk was the fourth highest dollar value agricultural product in the United States (at 8 percent of total receipts). It also identified that the dairy industry contributed 2 percent of the total US GHG emissions.

Among the factors affecting the cost to produce a pound of milk are feed cost, cow productivity (pounds produced per cow, per day), animal nutrition, genetics, and proper farm maintenance and housing of animals. For example, an increase in feed cost without a corresponding increase in cow milk productivity will squeeze farmer profits. It is not unusual to have milk production costs above the farmer’s selling price. According to Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin, when total milk production costs are above the wholesale price, farmers are forced to take one of a few actions.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_017">Sara Schoenborn, “Stephenson Hopeful, Realistic about 2011 Dairy Outlook,” <em class="emphasis">AG Weekly</em>, January 27, 2011, accessed January 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.agriview.com/news/dairy/stephenson-hopeful-realistic-about-dairy-outlook/article_fc01890d-cfda-5b25-a196-50ab45dbdaa1.html">http://www.agriview.com/news/dairy/stephenson-hopeful-realistic-about-dairy-outlook/article_fc01890d-cfda-5b25-a196-50ab45dbdaa1.html</a>.</span> These actions include the use of genetic engineering (putting <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">human growth hormones</a><span class="glossdef">Growth hormone (GH) is a protein-based polypeptide hormone.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p03">Stephenson noted that weather and temperature abnormalities across the globe have dramatically affected not only the quality of feed but also the feed prices.

These changing weather patterns had raised feed prices, especially corn prices, in Australia, Indonesia, and New Zealand.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p04">While a very small overall global contributor to GHG emissions worldwide, Oakhurst has successfully addressed its emissions in ways that have been beneficial to the company’s profitability and reputation. This has been accomplished by installing solar panels, retrofitting the company’s truck fleet, and using advanced rerouting software for its delivery trucks. With these efforts and others, Oakhurst has lowered its annual carbon emissions by more than one thousand metric tons and lowered its operating costs, primarily fuel costs, significantly. In periods of rising and highly volatile oil prices, fuel cost savings have been significant for Oakhurst. At the same time, its actions have reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the environment and to consumers in Maine and beyond, which has been beneficial to its standing among consumers, particularly those who cared about the environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p05">The large majority of milk consumers are most concerned about price, not carbon footprints. Reflective of this, Walmart and other large milk retailers are increasingly demanding lower pricing for the milk they get from Oakhurst and other milk processors. According to the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, cutthroat tactics “are making a mess of the dairy aisle.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_019">John Jannarone, “Heard on the Street: Grocers Still Milking Dean Foods,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone</a>.</span> The article reported that “grocery stores continue to use deep discounts to attract cash-strapped shoppers, sometimes selling milk at a loss.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_020">John Jannarone, “Heard on the Street: Grocers Still Milking Dean Foods,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone</a>.</span> These practices and pressure from the retailers have forced milk processors to take drastic action in lowering the cost they pay for their supplies. Even Dean Foods, the largest milk processor in the United States, has struggled to pass on price cuts to their raw products suppliers, and this has resulted in significant financial pressure on the milk processors. The recent sharp increase in milk costs has caused dramatic drops in Dean’s profits and stock price. Analysts were predicting further drops in Dean’s earning in 2011, which could violate the company’s leverage covenant with its banks and force the company into bankruptcy.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_021">John Jannarone, “Heard on the Street: Grocers Still Milking Dean Foods,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p07">One controversial strategy to increase productivity and cut costs per gallon of milk is the use of the human growth hormone rBST in cow feed. While the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of rBST in cow feed in 1993, the controversy was far from resolved. Some scientific studies have shown that milk produced this way is safe and has the same amount of proteins, fats, and nutrients as non-hormone-fed cows.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_023">Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is a synthetic version of the bovine somatotropin (BST) hormone found in cattle. The use of rBST has met with some controversy from a variety of fronts, including the animal rights movement and some commercial dairy farmers. As a result, dairies that produce milk products without the use of rBST have begun indicating this on their labels. Though rBST has been banned in several countries, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States has determined it to be safe to consume. See “What Does rBST Free Mean?,” wiseGEEK, accessed March 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-rbst-free-mean">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-rbst-free-mean</a>.</span> Other studies contradict these findings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p08">Oakhurst took a firm stand against the use of the hormone rBST in cow feed. In 1997, Stanley Bennett asked its farmers to sign an affidavit pledging not to use human growth hormone. In return they received financial incentives, and shortly after, Oakhurst began marketing its milk as free of the human hormone rBST. In 2003, Monsanto, the largest manufacturer of rBST, sued Oakhurst claiming that Oakhurst’s labels deceived consumers by marketing a perception that one milk product is safer or of higher quality than other milk. At the time of the suit, Monsanto’s worldwide sales revenue from rBST was $4.7 billion. Stanley Bennett countered that Oakhurst made no claim on the science involved with growth hormones.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_024">Drew Kaplan, “Monsanto Sues Oakhurst Dairy over Advertising,” Health Freedom Alliance, June 18, 2010, accessed February 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://healthfreedoms.org/2010/06/18/monsanto-sues-oakhurst-dairy-over-advertising">http://healthfreedoms.org/2010/06/18/monsanto-sues-oakhurst-dairy-over-advertising</a>.</span> He stated, “We’re in the business of marketing milk, not Monsanto’s drugs.” After an intense legal battle, Oakhurst settled the suit. Bill Bennett recalled, “Although the fight with Monsanto was expensive, Stanley Bennett didn’t waver. Stanley was very proud of our stand with Monsanto. We thought it was very important to be able to tell our consumers what was not in our milk.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_025">John Jannarone, “Heard on the Street: Grocers Still Milking Dean Foods,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703445904576118502653780560.html?KEYWORDS=jannarone</a>.</span></p>
