        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Green Mountain’s success is best reflected in the rise of its stock price. From 2007 to 2010, GMCR’s stock rose by more than 2,700 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 declined by 8 percent. From Green Mountain’s initial IPO in September 1993, its stock had increased by 15,400 percent, significantly better than the S&amp;P 500’s 165 percent gain.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn07_004">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc., <em class="emphasis">Annual Report 2009</em>, accessed April 16, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gmcr.com/Investors/AnnualReport.aspx">http://www.gmcr.com/Investors/AnnualReport.aspx</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="simpara">Bob Stiller Profile</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p02">Sometimes entrepreneurs really do become billionaires overnight. That’s what happened to Robert Stiller, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR). The value of his 12% holding in Green Mountain perked up 42% last Thursday and is now worth just over $1 billion. The jump came just after his Vermont coffee company announced a strategic relationship with Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). Green Mountain, also the owner of Keurig Single-Cup brewing system, will now make, market and sell Starbucks and Tazo tea K-Cups.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p03">I profiled Stiller as Entrepreneur of the Year nearly a decade ago in a 2001 Forbes cover story. At the time, his stake in the company was worth $89 million. I tried to reach him again this week, to no avail, but I recall his story well.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p04">Stiller, who is probably now 67, was a born entrepreneur. His first big hit was selling rolling paper on the drug-sodden campus of Columbia University in the early 1970s. His brand, E-Z Wider, had double the width of competing brands. The paper wouldn’t feed into the machine properly, causing tearing. Stiller figured out a way to prevent ripping and eventually made a small fortune. “People expected to see potheads, but we were more efficient at paper conversion than any manufacturer at the time,” he told me back then. He and a partner sold out in 1980, each pocketing $3.1 million.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p05">After cashing out, Stiller found himself at his ski condo in Sugarbush, Vermont, looking for his next opportunity. Enjoying a rare cup of good coffee at a restaurant one night, he started roasting his own beans, using a hot-air popcorn popper at one point, a cookie sheet at another, brewing batches of coffee for friends. Stiller ended up buying the store that had sold him that memorable cup of coffee in 1981 and after some twists and turns built it into Green Mountain.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p06">One of his smartest bets was investing in, and eventually, buying the Keurig single-cup system, created by three entrepreneurs. That business is now driving much of Green Mountain’s growth these days. Fiscal 2010 sales were up 73% to $1.36 billion, with majority of revenues coming from Keurig.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p07">Stiller stepped down as chief executive in 2007 but is still chairman. In addition to his holding in his coffee business, he apparently has a stake in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and owns a small private air charter, Heritage Flight, according to a story in a <em class="emphasis">Vermontbiz</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p09">GMCR keeps track of its social and sustainability efforts in three areas: the amount of fair trade coffee (organic and nonorganic) purchased as a percentage of total coffee purchased (with a goal of at least 30 percent of all coffee purchased to be Fair Trade Certified coffee); the price it pays to farmers for premium coffee over the prevailing market price; and the dollars contributed in grants to aid its numerous supply chain partners, especially to its farmers and community partners (with a goal of at least 5 percent of profits going to aid supply chain partners and other community partners). Fair Trade USA, the leading third-party certifier of fair trade products, named GMCR the largest purchaser of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the world for 2010. GMCR purchased more than twenty-six million pounds of Fair Trade Certified coffee in 2010.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p10">With its purchase of Fair Trade Certified (FTC) coffee, GMCR was able to identify early on and exploit market opportunities in the United States for the growing consumer interest in Fair Trade Certified organic and nonorganic coffee. With FTC coffee purchases, GMCR was able to help address the well-being of farmers in coffee exporting countries. The company did this by providing farmers and their workers a fair (also known as “living”) wage and grants to help them with medical, educational, and other economic and social needs. With the purchase of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fair Trade Certified organic coffee</a><span class="glossdef">Coffee that is grown under standards and guidelines that attempt to reduce the environmental impact (devastation) that is occurring in coffee-producing countries.</span></span>, GMCR also attempted to reduce the environmental devastation that occurred in coffee producing countries brought on by mass clearing and mass production of coffee crops. Management used these innovative supply chain practices and associated social investments as a source of a competitive advantage in the highly competitive specialty coffee industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p11">GMCR senior managers believed that once consumers understood the company’s sustainability goals and practices—protecting scarce resources, strengthening communities, reducing poverty, and ensuring equity in commercial relationships—they would be more likely to purchase the company’s products and thereby “partner” with the company to help build a better world.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn07_006">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc., <em class="emphasis">Brewing a Better World: VOICES</em>, accessed May 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gmcr.com/PDF/gmcr_csr_2008.pdf">http://www.gmcr.com/PDF/gmcr_csr_2008.pdf</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Management believed that its fair trade approach also created a “win-win” situation for the company and supply chain partners. By improving the quality of life for farmers, their families, and workers, Green Mountain sought to foster <em class="emphasis">trust</em> and closer working relationships in its supply chain. And management viewed this as investments that could help GMCR more effectively monitor quality and lower costs by assisting and negotiating directly with farm cooperatives. By lowering dependency on other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supply chain intermediates</a><span class="glossdef">Firm or person (such as a broker or consultant) who acts as a mediator on a link between parties to a business deal, investment decision, negotiation, and so on. In the coffee supply chain, a trader, for example, acts as intermediary between farmers seeking a fair price for their coffee and roasters looking to buy coffee at a fair price. Intermediaries usually specialize in specific areas and serve as conduits for market and other types of information. Also sometimes called a “middleman.”</span></span> in procuring its coffee, the company could lower supply chain logistical and procurements costs, improve turnaround time, and respond more quickly to customer preferences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p02">By 2009, Green Mountain was one of the largest purveyors of fair trade coffee in the United States. Fair Trade Certified coffee represented about 30 percent of Green Mountain’s overall coffee pounds sold in 2009, which was a 36 percent increase over 2008.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p01">In 2008, GMCR began sharing and measuring <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vendor</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as a supplier. A firm that provides raw materials or services to another firm. A vendor can be a manufacturer, producer, or seller.</span></span> compliance to a set of guidelines. These guidelines outlined what Green Mountain expected from its vendors regarding environmental, health, and safety standards. These standards included vendor legal compliance, labor conditions, and environmental responsibility. For measuring compliance, GMCR created a set of tools, including self-assessments, surveys, on-site assessments by GMCR staff, and commissioned audits of vendor facilities. Management tested these tools by auditing its Waterbury, Vermont, facility.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn07_007">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc., <em class="emphasis">Brewing a Better World: VOICES</em>, accessed May 30, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gmcr.com/PDF/gmcr_csr_2008.pdf">http://www.gmcr.com/PDF/gmcr_csr_2008.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p02">GMCR’s goal for its coffee supply chain was ambitious: to help the people in coffee-growing communities lead healthier and more prosperous lives. To facilitate the accomplishment of this goal, GMCR’s used two outreach initiatives. First, the company provided on-the-ground assistance by helping suppliers improve their ability to deliver high-quality specialty coffee to the marketplace. Areas of assistance included advice on cultivation techniques, training on cupping skills, and connecting suppliers with industry resources to help farmers strengthen and grow their business. Second, GMCR provided financial grants to nonprofits that both provided technical skills and helped communities achieve a more sustainable future.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn07_008">John M.
