    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">Voluntary frameworks or guidelines have emerged to help businesses determine how to report on their sustainability performance. These tools provide structure that can help businesses get started with sustainability reporting or help businesses that are already reporting on sustainable performance improve or expand their reporting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_p02">There are many different sustainability reporting guidelines and frameworks for businesses to choose among. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is one of the most common and encompasses the three spheres of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. In this section, the GRI G3 Sustainability Guidelines will be discussed in greatest detail to help the reader understand the type of information in a reporting framework.</p>
    <div class="section" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Reporting Initiative</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was started in 1997 by the NGO the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) and today collaborates as an independent entity with the United Nations Environmental Program and the UN Secretary General’s Global Compact. Ceres developed the Global Reporting Initiative to help companies report sustainability performance in a similar way as financial information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p02">The GRI provides a consistent way for companies to voluntarily measure and report progress on economic, ecological, and social performance of their businesses. In 2009, 1,400 GRI based reports were registered by reporting entities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p03">GRI first released the guidelines in 2000, and the current version, G3, was published in 2006. The framework is continuously improved as knowledge of sustainability issues evolves and the priorities of reporters and report users change. In March 2011, GRI released the G3.1 guidelines (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/guidelines-online/G31Online/Pages/default.aspx">https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/guidelines-online/G31Online/Pages/default.aspx</a>), which is an update and revision to the G3 guidelines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p04">The G3.1 guidelines provide seventy-nine performance indicators. Fifty of these indicators are “core” and twenty-nine are “additional.”</p>
