    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p01">Sustainability involves taking a holistic perspective to understand the true short-term and long-term impacts of a business activity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Life cycle</a><span class="glossdef">A view of a process from its beginning to its end.</span></span> thinking has emerged as a useful tool in sustainability to consider the total impacts of an activity, product, or service from its origin to its end. This differs from conventional business practices in which the focus has traditionally been on more immediate factors, such as cost, quality, and availability in the supply chain. Life cycle thinking still takes into account these factors but considers them over a product’s lifetime. While conventional business practices have given limited consideration to disposal costs, life cycle thinking considers the impacts of disposal to be an important part of the overall process of product or service provision.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p02">Life cycle thinking in a business context considers business activities using a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cradle to grave</a><span class="glossdef">A term used in life cycle thinking that represents the consideration of a specific entity or activity from the process of activities leading to its inception to its disposal.</span></span>” perspective. Cradle to grave starts by considering the impacts of raw material extraction and other inputs. It considers transportation of inputs to the organization and the impacts of the transformation process into a useful product or service that occur at the organization. It then considers transportation from the organization through the use of the product or service up to the ultimate disposal. Each step in the life cycle features a specific focus on inputs and outputs, such as raw materials and waste.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p03">Life cycle thinking came into attention in the 1960s, when life-cycle-based accounting was first used to account for environmental emissions and economic costs associated with various energy technologies over their life cycle. Life cycle thinking has evolved as a sophisticated method for businesses to consider their environmental and social impacts.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Life Cycle Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p01">The management philosophy that integrates a comprehensive life cycle approach for organizations in managing their value chain is called life cycle management (LCM). A value chain is the connected activities that an organization undertakes in providing a product or service, with each interconnected activity adding value. LCM is a systematic progress of organizing, analyzing, and managing of sustainability impacts throughout the entire life cycle of a product, process, or activity. LCM can occur at the product or service level or at the entire company level. For example, a company may be interested in managing the life cycle of one of its products to improve sustainability, or it may take a more comprehensive look at the portfolio of activities that it engages in as part of a more far-reaching approach to sustainability. One of the key benefits of life cycle management is that it can alert management to potential “hot spots,” or areas that may be ecologically or socially problematic.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Sidebar</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p02">So how might LCM play out in real life? For example, if a company is selecting raw materials for the production of a product, they may have several material options to consider. The company can have a goal of choosing materials that have a higher degree of sustainability, meaning less negative societal impact or greater positive societal impact.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p03">For example, if a product could be produced with three pounds of plastic material or two pounds of wood material, which material selection would result in lower pollution emissions per unit of product produced? Which would use less water? The impacts may vary depending on what other materials are required; for example, wood may require paint, while plastic would not. What about the quality of labor conditions for where the wood is harvested versus where the plastic was produced?</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Materials that do not have environmental and social impact do not exist; every material has some form of impact. LCM can be used to manage for ecologically and socially preferable products and services.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Phases of a Life Cycle</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p01">The following figure illustrates three key phases in a life cycle. Cradle is the resource extraction or impacts of elements that serve as inputs to the process. Throughout the business activity or process, there are inputs and outputs, including water, energy, emissions, and waste. Upon completion of the activity, the finished output of the activity is at the gate. The gate is the defining point when a business output activity is completed and it moves beyond the organization to the next step in its life cycle. For example, the gate at a factory that produces tablet PCs is when the manufactured tablet is boxed and ready to be shipped from the factory. Between the gate and up until the grave is the active use phase of the output of the organization, with the grave being the ultimate disposal of the output.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p02">Two terms that are associated with the life cycle are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">upstream</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of the value chain that plays a role in the supply chain of the producing organization. This can include extraction and transportation of raw materials.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">downstream</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of the value chain that plays a role in a later step in the product life cycle past the producing organization itself. This can include the distribution, use, or disposal of goods.</span></span> processes. Upstream refers to activities occurring before the organization (supply chain) and downstream refers to activities occurring after the organization (product distribution and product use and disposal). Upstream and downstream can also be in reference to a specific point in the life cycle. For example, a company might be interested in the impacts of all activities “upstream” of a specific supplier. While business life cycles frequently are focused on products or tangible goods, it can also apply to services.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p03">Life cycle management does not need to consider the entire life cycle, but instead, it can consider discrete phases or parts. This depends on the needs of the organization. Sometimes, the greatest opportunities for reducing environmental or social impacts may exist outside a company’s own operations and in its supply chain, in which case, life cycle management would focus on its supply chain. Or the assembly of a product might be quite complex, and life cycle management is focused on one specific part of the assembly process.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p04">Different types of life cycle management include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Cradle to grave includes the whole product life cycle from beginning to disposal.</li>
                <li>Cradle to gate focuses on the phase from input extraction through the organization output, but not downstream impact.</li>
                <li>Cradle to cradle specifically focuses on the end-of-life step being recycling. This type of life cycle management is becoming more in focus where considerable attention is paid in designing products so that they can become part of another beneficial use and not be disposed of as waste.</li>

There are economic, social, and environmental impacts associated with the harvesting of the wheat, vegetables, and beef required as inputs to the burger. Other impacts would be associated with the napkins, packaging, condiments, and other supplies. There are also impacts associated with the transportation of these inputs to the restaurant. These impacts would be considered upstream.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p02">As part of the transformation process, inputs—such as water, electricity, and raw ingredients—are required. Waste is generated in the process of producing the burger and pollution emissions are generated—for example, carbon dioxide and other forms of air pollution are generated depending on the type of power plant that generated the electricity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p03">The gate would be the customer receiving the burger at the checkout counter.

                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p04">One sustainable performance indicator (SPI) that could be used in life cycle thinking is to consider the total energy used in the production of a product. A 500-calorie cheeseburger requires about 1,700 calories of energy from oil and electricity to make it from the farm to the finished product at a restaurant. This means that it takes more energy to make a burger than we receive from eating the burger. This negative energy flow and its dependence on fossil fuels has its own implications for the sustainability of eating cheeseburgers, but from the restaurant owner perspective, they would be most interested in the areas where changes to their business practices would have the most impact in reducing energy use.</p>
                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p05">One option for the restaurant owner is to consider which ingredients of the burger have the greatest energy impact in their life cycle. Almost 80 percent of the energy in a cheeseburger comes from all the steps associated with producing, preparing, and cooking of the hamburger meat. This would be an area for the restaurant owner to focus on. Cheese and bread are also two ingredients that require a significant amount of energy in the cheeseburger life cycle.</p>

The area with the biggest impact on the energy use of a cheeseburger is agricultural activities, or the activities that occur at the farm. This suggests that the biggest impacts on energy use that a restaurant owner can make actually occur in his supply chain and not at his own facility. This might be a finding that the owner may never have expected or have known about without considering his operations from a life cycle perspective. Only about 10 percent of the energy in the entire cheeseburger life cycle is generated on-site in the cooking of the burger; the other 90 percent comes from various upstream activities.</p>

Scope one consists of direct emissions from an organization’s operations. An example of scope one would be emissions from fuel consumed to heat a building. Scope two emissions are emissions from energy purchased by the organization that are generated outside of the organization. Typically, this would be the emissions from power plants for the electricity used by an organization. Scope three emissions are emissions from sources outside of the organization but related to an organization’s business activities. Supplier emissions and emissions related to transportation not directly owned by the organization would fall under scope three emissions.</p>

The water footprint is an indicator of water use that looks at both direct and indirect water use. A product or corporate water footprint is the first step toward identifying the processes and activities, which significantly influence an organization’s water use. The water footprint of a product (good or service) is the volume of fresh water used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the value chain. The water footprint of a business consists of its direct water use for producing, manufacturing, and supporting activities plus its indirect water use—that is, the water used in the business’s supply chain.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_018">Institute for Water Education, <em class="emphasis">Water Neutral: Reducing and Offsetting the Impacts of Water Footprints</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report28-WaterNeutral.pdf">http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report28-WaterNeutral.pdf</a>.</span></p>
