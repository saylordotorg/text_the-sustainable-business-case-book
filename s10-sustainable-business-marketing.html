        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_p04">Sustainable marketing is not just about taking steps to appear more environmentally friendly or more socially conscious and advertising that fact to consumers. It is more substantive and meaningful. Sustainable marketing draws on traditional marketing methods and in addition requires the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_l02">
            <li>Understanding of consumer’s values, emotions, and buying behavior related to sustainability</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p01">An increasing number of consumers base their purchases in some way on the environmental and social impact of the product and services they buy and the companies from which they purchase. In an October 2011 study, Cone Communications and Echo Research identified that 81 percent of respondents said that companies had a responsibility to “address key social and environmental issues” and 76 percent of respondents said they had bought a product with “an environmental benefit” in the last twelve months.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_001">“2011 Cone/Echo Global CR Report,” Cone Communications, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.coneinc.com/2011globalcrreport">http://www.coneinc.com/2011globalcrreport</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">Kermit the frog may have had it right—“It’s not easy being green.” There is a lot to consider when creating a sustainable marketing strategy. It is not simply adding “green” to your brand platform or announcing that you support a worthy cause. To be most successful, a commitment to sustainability should be part of the company’s overall vision and an integral part of the company’s values and fundamental beliefs. For example, Seventh Generation, a Vermont-based company that makes personal and household cleaning products, adheres to a model of deeper business purpose (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch12#gittell_1.0-ch12">Chapter 8 "Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product"</a>). The company’s founder, Jeffrey Hollender, had a vision to create and nurture a company with sustainability at the core. Everything that the company does focuses on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit for the greater good. From their products—which are made using only natural, recycled, or renewable materials—to their philanthropic efforts that seek to help create a sustainable community, Seventh Generation employs a well-integrated sustainability vision and strategy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">A strong sustainability strategy includes understanding how the company impacts the people and environment in which it operates and consciously applies sustainable practices throughout <em class="emphasis">every</em> element of its business. Companies such as Timberland (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch10#gittell_1.0-ch10">Chapter 11 "Case: Accounting for Sustainability: How Does Timberland Do It and Why?"</a>) and Procter &amp; Gamble have adopted sustainability practices and have set specific and measureable goals—both short and longer term—to reduce their company’s carbon footprint. This includes actively examining the carbon lifecycle of their products—from the raw materials used in manufacturing all the way through to the recycling phase to ensure that they are meeting these goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">Inherent in this practice is the concept of radical transparency, whereby everything the company does is transparent and visible to the consumer and community at large, which contributes to the credibility of the sustainable brand. Measureable goals contribute to radical transparency as they provide clear and actionable goals to which the company can commit and progress against. For example, Unilever’s sustainable strategy commits to aggressively reducing their environmental impact and enhancing livelihoods by the year 2020. Unilever has made sustainability the cornerstone of their mission with clear, transparent goals against which they will be measured.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_005">“Unilever Sustainable Living Plan,” Unilever, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf">http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf</a>.</span></p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Corporate goals.</strong> These are the overall company goals that should be in line with the company’s vision and long-term strategic plan.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Objectives.</strong> Determine marketing objectives. Objectives should be stated clearly and should stem from the overall company’s vision and goals. Objectives should have specificity, such as to grow to 5 percent market share.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Strategies.</strong> After objectives are determined, strategies (which are how you are going to achieve the objectives) should be developed. An example is to convert all product ingredients to those that are locally sourced to help meet the objective of minimizing the company’s carbon footprint.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tactics.</strong> Tactics are the specific means or programs to achieve the strategies and this includes the four Ps (see the following). One example is identifying the local suppliers and costs to achieve a buy local strategy.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Market.</strong> Determine what market you are participating in and what stage your product or service is in its life cycle: development, introduction, growth, maturity, or decline (see the following sidebar titled “Product Life Cycle”). For green products especially, there may be opportunity to add a new dimension to a mature category with a new product benefit. For example, in the mature category of yogurt, Stonyfield Yogurt (see <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch13#gittell_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Case: Strategic Mission–Driven Sustainable Business: Stonyfield Yogurt"</a>) was able to breathe new life into the category when they first launched in 1984 with an organic product.

        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_p08">There are basically five stages of the product life cycle, including the development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stages. Customers will only be able to purchase products in the latter four stages because the product typically has not yet been placed on the market in the development stage.

Sustainability marketing, unlike traditional marketing, needs to adhere well to sustainability principles throughout the marketing mix. This helps to (1) strengthen the brand identity; (2) provide credibility; and (3) ensure honest, truthful communications and radical transparency with stakeholders, one of the cornerstones of good sustainability marketing principles.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p03">Another one of the keys to sustainable packaging is to ensure that the product-to-packaging ratio is “right-sized”—meaning that the product tightly fits in the packaging and there is no wasted use of packaging materials or “air space.” This is not only for the package itself but also for the packing case, which houses multiples of the products for shipping. This is often referred to as “cube optimization.” Cube optimization means right-sizing packages and fitting orders into packaging dimensions that are as small as possible without threatening the integrity of the order. Tight packaging-to-product ratios accomplish two things: (1) they reduce use of packaging materials and (2) they reduce energy costs as the pallet loads are more condensed and the manufacturer is not paying to transport “air.” Additionally, as more and more products are being shipped globally in containers by ocean, air, trucks, and rail, every inch of transport space and fuel usage is significant. This is an example of a win-win situation for the business and the environment, as shipping more in the same volume of space cuts shipping costs, impacting the business bottom line, while reducing the amount of energy (and associated greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) needed, positively impacting the environmental “bottom line.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p04">Using renewably sourced materials is another way companies can create more sustainable packaging.

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Price</strong> is the monetary (or bartered) amount a consumer pays for a product or service based on the product or service’s value or worth. For sustainable products, pricing has often been an issue limiting a product’s or service’s mass acceptance and market growth. Green products tend to be more expensive because the ingredients may cost more than their conventional counterparts. For example, organic food grown with natural fertilizers may be more expensive than those foods not utilizing natural fertilizers. Manufacturing and transportation costs can also be higher. For example, if the transport costs use a higher cost but lower polluting renewable energy fuel source, this will contribute to a higher price point. This creates a price gap between conventional products and those that are sustainable, which is often referred to as the “green pricing gap.” The higher price can be a barrier to wide market acceptance for many green products, as some consumers may want to purchase products that are better for the environment but either do not want or are financially unable to pay a higher price. For the large majority of consumers, if they do not receive additional value from a sustainable product, for example, in the form of reduced energy costs or longer product lives, they will not pay a premium for the sustainable product. If a product is competitive in terms of price, as well as product, place, and promotion, with traditional products and services, sustainability can give that product a competitive edge particularly among consumers with some interest in sustainability such as the middle green.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s03_p02">Marketers need to minimize the price barrier either by reducing the price point to be closer to its conventional counterparts or through marketing efforts to raise the perceived value to command a premium. Products, such as organic food brands, Earth’s Best, and Starbucks with their fair trade coffee, have done a commendable job in creating greater perceived value, thus commanding premium pricing. Some green product marketers use effective targeting to minimize the green price gap by targeting either people who are better off financially (those who can better afford to take environmental factors into their consumption decisions) or particular market or consumer groups, such as super greens and green regional markets (e.g., Portland, Oregon), with concentrations of potential customers who derive value in conspicuous conservation and demonstrating their environmentalism.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_019">Lindsay Kauffman, “Green as a Status Symbol: Why Increased Prices May Increase Sales,” Triplepundit.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/05/green-status-increase-prices-increase-sales">http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/05/green-status-increase-prices-increase-sales</a>.</span></p>

One way to create a so-called win-win for consumers of sustainable products is to capitalize on what can help really motivate consumers to use green products—cost savings from using green products. Some consumers recognize this benefit as some green products save them money in the long run, such as driving a hybrid car saves at the gas pump; energy efficient light bulbs, refrigerators, washers, and dryers save on energy costs; water conservation shower heads save on the water bill; and using refillable water bottles is much cheaper than buying plastic water bottles at the store. Combining a concrete benefit like saving money with a sustainable benefit strengthens the brand messaging and may help to minimize the green pricing gap.</p>

The traditional marketing efforts, which normally work well for a more traditional CPG brand, were a flop. Why? Because a big splashy marketing campaign was not in keeping with their “honest” brand image nor did it capitalize on the way that Honest Tea’s following had been built. Honest Tea’s success had been developed through grassroots marketing, which gave the brand an elite following that said, “We are not like everyone else—we require something special.”</p>

                    <li>A sustainable marketing strategy works best when it adapts and complements the overall corporate sustainability vision of the company, personifies the brand image, and is clearly and transparently executed throughout all marketing elements.</li>
                    <li>For an effective sustainable marketing approach, the four Ps, product, price, place, and promotion, should be based on sustainability principles and should align with overall marketing strategy.</li>
                    <li>Consumer target market segmentation is effective to better tailor marketing efforts to those consumer’s that align best as potential buyers or customers of a given product or service.</li>
                    <li>Physical products can be made more sustainable through considering ways to minimize materials use, minimize the negative impact of the production process, and maximize the efficiency of the distribution process.</li>
                    <li>Packaging changes, such as encouraging reusable bags, a tighter packaging-to-product ratio, or cube optimization, can be effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of a product while increasing profitability.</li>

        <span class="blockquote" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p02">Green marketing messages targeting mainstream American consumers are missing the mark, according to a study released in 2011 by consultant group OgilvyEarth. The report included research that showed that many of the environmental messages of marketers were not just failing to close what the study called the Green Gap, but were actually cementing it by making green behavior too difficult and costly from a practical, financial, and social standpoint.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p03">“Many of the world’s leading corporations are staking their futures on the bet that sustainability will become a major driver of mainstream consumer purchase behavior. Unless they can figure out how to close the gap, there will never be a business case for green,” added Freya Williams, Co-Founder and Director of Strategy at OgilvyEarth and co-author of the study.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p04">The study found that 82% of Americans have good green intentions but only 16% are dedicated to fulfilling these intentions, putting 66% firmly in what the report called the “middle green.” Considering green behavior on a continuum, most of the dialogue and marketing to date according to the report has focused on “super greens” on the one hand and “green rejecters” on the other. There has been limited success in motivating the masses or the middle green.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p05">Existing green marketing is either irrelevant or even alienating to most Americans, the study asserts. Half of Americans think green and environmentally friendly products are marketed to “Crunchy Granola Hippies” or “Rich Elitist Snobs” rather than “Everyday Americans.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p06">The report highlighted that cost continues to be the greatest barrier that holds Americans back from more sustainable purchases.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p07">“One trip to the grocery store and you would see that green products can have as much as a 100% price premium. It’s as if we’re penalizing virtuous behaviors with a <em class="emphasis">de facto</em> sustainability tax,” says Bennett.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p08">But price was far from the only thing preventing consumer behavior change. The super green minority, according to the report, who venture into the green space do so with a relatively high social and emotional cost. They say they feel ostracized from their neighbors, families, and friends. Meanwhile the middle greens say they fear attracting the negative judgment of their peers if they go out on a limb to purchase green products. Until green products and services feel normal and adhere to normative pricing, the middle green are unlikely to embrace them.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p09">Nearly half of Americans claim to feel guiltier “the more they know” about how to live a sustainable lifestyle. Super greens feel twice the guilt as the average American. Even among the green middle, guilt plays a role. As it increases, these consumers want to retreat to the comfort of ignorance.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p10">“Understanding the prevalent misuse of appeals to a sense of guilt, we can see where sustainability marketing has gone wrong,” says Williams. “People don’t need to know about the state of polar bears in the Arctic to turn off the lights—paradoxically it may be stopping them from doing so.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_p11">The barrier to adopting sustainable behaviors is even higher for men. Fully 82% of respondents say going green is “more feminine than masculine.” More men identify as Green Rejecters, and the ranks of the Super Greens are dominated by women. This feminization holds men back from visible green behavior like using reusable grocery bags or carrying around reusable water bottles.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Price</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p01">Price is a well-recognized hurdle for many consumers in purchasing sustainable products and services. Sixty-six percent of US consumers view environmentally friendly products as too expensive. Whether consumers are looking to purchase an energy saving light bulb or environmentally friendly home cleaning products, these products often cost more than the most popular consumer versions. Often the premium price puts these products out of the reach or interest of the majority of consumers. And the price premium as a hurdle is magnified during economic downturns.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Overall, 83 percent of global online consumers reported in Nielsen’s 2011 Global Online Environment and Sustainability Survey (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/press-room/2011/global-warming-cools-off-as-top-concern.html">http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/press-room/2011/global-warming-cools-off-as-top-concern.html</a>) say that it is important that companies implement programs to improve the environment, but only 22 percent say they will pay more for an eco-friendly product. Willingness to pay extra for environmentally friendly goods is highest in the Middle East and Africa, where one-third of consumers are willing, and lowest in North America, where only 12 percent of both Canadians and Americans say they will pay extra for eco-friendly products. Many consumers reported a personal preference for eco-friendly goods, but large percentages of respondents report setting aside this preference and buying whichever product is cheapest, including 48 percent in North America, 36 percent in the Middle East and Africa, 35 percent in Europe, 33 percent in Asia Pacific, and 27 percent in Latin America.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p03">The price premium compared to the conventional alternative needs to be addressed through the three other parts of the marketing mix (product, place, and promotion). But the most effective way to address the price premium is to address it directly—to find ways to reduce it. Reducing the sustainable price premium is a key factor in having a greater percentage of average consumers purchase more environmentally favorable products.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p01">Marketers need to clearly communicate the product’s benefits and sustainable position especially when commanding a premium price. The challenge is that greener products do not have a stellar history of performing well. In the 1970s, green laundry detergents were developed as a result of concerns over phosphates—a chemical that can cause environmental degradation in large quantities—and resulted in gray, dingy clothes. The original organic cereals tasted like cardboard to many consumers and the early versions of energy efficient light bulbs cast a green glow. Many consumers—roughly a third in the United States and around the globe—still question the efficacy of green products versus their regular, nongreen product alternatives despite strides made in product performance.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p05">A good example of this is Glad Products Company’s 2011 introduction of a version of its Glad tall kitchen drawstring trash bag that is made with less plastic. Glad Products, a joint venture of the Clorox Company and Procter &amp; Gamble, spent over $30 million on a campaign to introduce the trash bags. The bags were billed in ads and on packages as “strength with less plastic” and “stronger with less plastic waste.” (The bags were made using 6.5 percent less plastic than before, Glad Products executives say, and have what are called reinforcing bands to make the bags stronger.)<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_030">Stuart Elliot, “Glad Cuts the Hyperbole for Its New Green Trash Bag,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 19, 2011.</span> The company smartly kept the price at parity to more conventional counterparts, thereby eliminating the green pricing gap. They have made it easier for consumers to adopt this more sustainable product. Moreover, they have positioned it correctly by combining an efficacy product benefit, “stronger,” with a sustainable benefit, “with less plastic/less plastic waste.” That’s a win-win-win.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Behavioral Change</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p01">Many sustainable practices require consumers to change their habits and adopt new ones. Recycling, turning off the lights, lowering the thermostat in winter, using recyclable bags for shopping—all require changing behavior. Typically changing a behavior is a slow process as consumers have to be retaught a habit. That is why <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Generation Y</a><span class="glossdef">Refers broadly to the demographic cohort born between 1978 and 1995.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p02">Most behavioral changes are more readily adopted when there is a perceived consumer benefit, for example, using a kitchen bag with less plastic that is stronger and driving a fuel-efficient car that saves money at the gas pump. Using a more energy efficient, longer-lasting light bulb and a programmable thermostat can save on energy costs and conserving water using a more efficient toilet saves on the water bill. Marketers can help consumers more quickly adopt new behavior and buy new products when they highlight the benefits and long-term cost savings in promoting the product.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_p01">Although sustainability continues to grow as an important business concept, focusing on sustainability in marketing entails significant risks that need to be addressed. These risks can cause problems with a company’s marketing plan, short and long term.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_p02">The sustainable marketing risks can be categorized as follows:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_l02">
        <li>Market risks</li>
        <li>Operating risks</li>

    </ol>
    <div class="section" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Market Risks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p01">Addressing market risks are part of a normal strategy and marketing plan development process, but sustainability adds a dimension of uncertainty due to its relative “newness.” Marketing sustainability is in its high-risk phase since the consumer appeal for sustainability is still not well defined. It is true that consumers, when polled, will espouse sustainability’s benefits and appeal, but a gap currently exists between the consumers’ words and actions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p02">As a result, the following market risks are associated with sustainability initiatives:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Weakness in sustainability’s consumer appeal, particularly relative to more basic incentives, such as value, convenience, and efficacy</li>
            <li>Lack of understanding and personal appreciation of sustainability’s benefits among consumer groups</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p03">In the abstract, consumers easily agree that the coupling of economic and environmental sustainability is a very positive concept. Who would argue that working to ensure that future generations have the resources to enjoy success is a negative idea? This apparent universal appeal has led more than a few marketers to believe that sustainability as a consumer benefit has mass potential. Consumer purchasing behavior to date, however, has not confirmed sustainability’s appeal for the majority of potential consumers. When marketers pit sustainability’s strength as a benefit against value in a low-price or low-cost provider differentiation strategy, sustainability seems to have only a limited impact. When marketers pit sustainability’s strength as a benefit against convenience and effectiveness in a differentiation strategy, sustainability also seems to have very limited impact. Sustainability marketers need to understand their “pioneer” role in capturing and leveraging sustainability benefits. Consumers still seem to be processing the value of sustainability as a benefit. Most importantly, consumers are still processing how much they would pay for this benefit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p04">In addition, sustainability often addresses externalities or failures of conventional products or services to fully cost the negative impact they have. Therefore the “price” of sustainability, whether it be an additional financial cost or a time or effort cost, is something that may make society collectively better off, while making an individual worst off for absorbing that additional cost. The marketer must find ways to communicate personal benefit as well as societal benefits. “It’s good for the environment” may not be good enough to convince a consumer to justify any personal cost or sacrifice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p05">Initial attempts to use sustainability as a key marketing benefit have demonstrated the nascent appeal. Niche businesses, such as Simply Green and Seventh Generation, as well as larger-scale companies such as Stonyfield seem to be able to define an industry segment using the sustainability platform. When mass marketers, attracted by the high growth rates in the “good-for-you, good-for-the-planet” segment, attempt to duplicate niche marketers’ success on a larger scale, the mass marketers have generated mixed results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p06">Examples include “green” product launches from Clorox, SC Johnson, and Dwight and Church. Although some products, supported by heavy introductory marketing programs, experienced initial success, the premium pricing for the products with no accompanying added benefit except for sustainability eventually led to a reduction in the size of the business. This was the case with Green Works from Clorox. Sales of Green Works reached $100 million in its introductory year. Clorox spent approximately $25 million in advertising in 2008 and 2009. Due primarily to the recession, which put pressure on premium-priced products, Green Works sales fell to $60 million and Clorox dropped advertising support to approximately $1 million.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p07">Sustainability as a key benefit is still developing, and the strength of the benefit versus established benefits of better value, lower price, more convenience, and more effectiveness is still not measurable or clear. Many consumers will purchase green products that make no compromises in other benefits. But most consumers will not buy when the green benefit comes at the expense of higher price or more conventional benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p08">The marketing discussion has focused on sustainability as a benefit in a product offered to consumers. When companies apply a sustainability focus as a corporate mandate, such as Timberland, the benefit to the business is also still to be determined. The number of consumers willing to buy a product from a “green” company or an outstanding corporate citizen instead of products from other companies with no such mandate is not definitive at this time. Marketers may believe that the “good” company will reap benefits over the “neutral” or “bad” companies, but unfortunately, this may not always be the case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p09">Nevertheless, current evidence suggests that consumers are finding the sustainability benefit to be appealing and will possibly become more influential for a consumer’s buying decision in the future. Sustainability as a benefit appeals to the logical and emotional sides of the consumer, offering potential for the development of a larger opportunity. Marketers must remember that they are still responsible for developing this opportunity by pioneering information dissemination to consumers and education about sustainability. Sustainability does not yet operate in a clearly defined opportunity space that allows companies to launch new products with no pioneering effort for mass success.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Operating Risks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p01">Chasing the opportunity presented by the growing awareness of sustainability also can create operating risks that need to be addressed during marketing plan development and execution. Much discussion on this subject has taken place, and the issues are fairly straightforward. The following operating risks are associated with pursuing sustainability initiatives as part of a marketing plan:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Loss in profitability</li>
            <li>Loss of focus</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p02">Just as sustainability would seem to be a rallying cry for consumers, some companies have jumped on sustainability as a rallying cry for employees. By incorporating sustainability into corporate mission statements and adding green to their products, some companies like Timberland believe that they can drive business improvement via a competitive advantage. All this seems to be a reasonable operating assumption, and a growing number of companies including Timberland have been successful operating under this assumption. Loss of profitability can occur, however, if a company uses more financial and human resources than competitors without gaining a commensurate benefit. As an example, activities designed to protect the environment have costs. If a company cannot price to recover these costs or if the costs do not lead to benefits that make products superior in the minds of the consumer, then the company now operates at a cost disadvantage versus competition. By internalizing these costs and not receiving a real benefit, a company may experience loss of sales, market share, and profitability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p03">In addition, adding sustainability to the marketing mix can lead to a loss of focus on the primary objective: economic profitability and economic sustainability. Driving activity through marketing to results that are not part of the core economic strategy may lead a company to damage its profitability by loss of focus and misallocation of critical resources.</p>

    <div class="section" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Corporate Image Risks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p01">The last risk classification deals with the risks to corporate image that can occur when pursuing sustainability marketing activities and goals. Although all marketing activities have implications for corporate image, sustainability marketing activities can create a higher level of positive or negative impact on image. This is probably because sustainability is a more altruistic and noble cause versus other business objectives and also increasingly of interest to the media and general public and therefore a highly visible company activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p02">The following corporate image risks are associated with sustainability marketing:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Negative greenwashing image</li>
            <li>Magnified negative impact of an inconsistent action</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Greenwashing</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of making an unsubstantiated or misleading claim about the environmental benefits of a product, service, or technology.</span></span> is the use of green marketing to give the incorrect impression that the company’s strategy, operations, and products are designed to be beneficial to the environment. The company attempts to market their green credentials to improve their public image to generate greater sales through positive “spin.” Companies embarking on this path are taking a significant risk because exposure of the company’s true activities and footprint could result in a relatively large negative impact on all elements of the marketing and public relations plan and eventually sales and profitability. Even companies that are sincere but are perceived to be insincere by the public can suffer grave consequences. It is imperative for companies employing sustainability marketing to be genuine in their motivation and effective in its execution. The damage done by even a hint of insincerity or with poor execution is potentially irreversible.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p04">Environmentalist Jay Westerveld coined the phrase in his 1986 essay regarding the hotel industry’s practice of using placards in each room to promote reuse of towels to “save the environment.” He wrote that many hotels made little effort toward energy use reduction. The principal goal of this activity was to increase profits.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p05">Since that time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has put some parameters into effect to help minimize greenwashing with its Green Guide, which was first published in 1998 and revised again in October 2010. The FTC Green Guide mandates that companies provide clear substantiation to any environmental claims and that there is specificity surrounding these claims. In particular, the FTC warns of using more generic terms such as “eco-friendly” and “environmentally friendly” without documented and detailed evidence to these claims. Failure to comply can cost a company up to $16,000 per false claim.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_031">Lee van der Voo, “FTC Takes a Swipe at Greenwashing,” <em class="emphasis">Sustainable Business Oregon</em>, May 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2010/10/new_ftc_rules_take_swipe_at_greenwashing.html">http://www.sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2010/10/new_ftc_rules_take_swipe_at_greenwashing.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p06">Even a company that has demonstrated its commitment to sustainability over time is still vulnerable, if not more vulnerable, to a misstep in its sustainability initiatives and action. Some companies may be able to generate goodwill through their past actions, but some consumers may take a “what have you done for me lately?” mind-set that does not provide the opportunity to generate this equity. As a result, marketers who incorporate sustainability marketing as an integral element of their plan must be aware of the importance in maintaining consistency and effective execution in its approach and commitment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p07">As an example, Green Mountain Coffee, a company that has sustainability among its core beliefs, has had some setbacks to its public image due to its biggest business success, Keurig coffee cups. Per its mantra, the company is aggressively researching methods to build a recyclable cup, but its current cups are not biodegradable. Green Mountain’s history has given it some protection from negative publicity, but this protection may wear down if a solution is not found in the short term. Once the company loses that essential part of their corporate image, Green Mountain runs the danger of becoming just another coffee company. (Green Mountain Coffee is discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch07#gittell_1.0-ch07">Chapter 9 "Case: Brewing a Better World: Sustainable Supply Chain Management at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc."</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p08">Although there is some significant disagreement and experience to support that disagreement, there is evidence that marketing that leverages sustainability attributes is relevant and important. Due to the unique and continuously changing positioning of sustainability in consumers’ minds, sustainability marketing comes with its own set of rewards and challenges. To be successful in sustainability marketing, a company must recognize and be ready to deal with the risks associated with this relatively new business concept.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s05_p01">Marketing to the “green” or sustainability market is different than marketing mainstream products. The products are held to higher standards, judged not only on the product’s effectiveness but also on delivering on societal and environmental responsibilities. When marketing sustainability it is important that dedication be given—from the initial stages of developing the product through to the products end of life—to environmental responsibilities while still delivering financial performance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s05_p02">The following are guidelines on how to market sustainable products effectively:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch06_s05_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make sure your product works.</strong> Ensure the product competitively delivers on <em class="emphasis">both</em> traditional and sustainability benefits. If the product doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how “green” it is.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be genuine in sustainability efforts.</strong> Fulfill the sustainability message throughout the entire product’s lifecycle—from sourcing of ingredients to the recycling process.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Market transparently.</strong> Consumers have come to develop a strong relationship with sustainable companies and brands. They demand transparency. Seventh Generation got into trouble with their baby wipes product when they changed the size of the packaging to have less wipes per package and did not effectively communicate the change to their consumers. Consumers felt “cheated” and lost faith in the company, which took some time to rebuild.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Strengthen your core.</strong> Corporate social responsibility needs to be at the core of your company’s business philosophy permeating the supply chain all the way through to treating employees fairly. Take, for example, Walmart, who has pledged to reduce their carbon footprint yet is getting sued for employee discrimination.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn06_032">“Plaintiffs in Walmart Suit File New Claim,” <em class="emphasis">Supermarket News</em>, Oct 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://supermarketnews.com/retail_financial/walmart_plantiffs_1027/?cid=upd">http://supermarketnews.com/retail_financial/walmart_plantiffs_1027/?cid=upd</a>.</span>
</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Manage any sustainable pricing gap.</strong> The high price of many of the sustainable products discourages consumers from purchasing and actually can be perceived as a sustainability tax or surcharge. Eliminating or reducing the price barrier helps to dispel the notion that green products are not just for the elite and will encourage more people to consume better-for-the-environment products.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t force the consumer to make big tradeoffs</strong>—whether it is price, performance, convenience, or a noisy package. Most consumers have not proven that they are willing to make significant sacrifices.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have patience.</strong> Most environmentally friendly consumer behavior requires behavioral changes, and behavioral change takes time. Generation Y and millennial consumers are more apt to embrace this change faster. As more and more companies are jumping on the green bandwagon and eliminating some of the barriers, change will evolve quicker to help shape this shift toward a more sustainable future.</li>
