An investor in a business expects that the managers of the company are working to maximize shareholder return and to not be wasteful of corporate resources.

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p05">There are numerous examples of companies’ social or environmental actions affecting consumer purchasing behavior both positively and negatively. In March 2011, Bob Parsons, the CEO of GoDaddy, the world’s largest provider of web hosting and domain name registrations, posted a video of him shooting an elephant in Zimbabwe, Africa, on the Internet. The video showed the elephant being killed and local villagers stripping flesh from the carcass of the dead elephant to a score of rock band AC/DC’s “Hells Bells.” While Parsons claimed the elephant was destroying the villagers’ crops and that he was actually providing a service to the local African community, his actions—and specifically the callous way that he documented his actions—spurred outrage from customers with many cancelling their accounts as a result. This is an example of how the social conduct of the CEO of a company carried over to the brand image of the company and resulted in a loss in revenue.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p06">In June 2011, Jewelers’ Circular Keystone (JCK), the jewelry industry’s leading trade publication, reported on the results of a survey that found 78 percent of consumers said they cared about sustainability and 60 percent of consumers said they were willing to pay a premium for “ethical jewelry.” Rebecca Foerster, the US vice president at Rio Tinto Diamonds, stated, “This generation that is up and coming is more concerned about where the products they are buying come from, and they are becoming activists about it.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_003">Rob Bates, “JCK Las Vegas: Consumers Want Sustainable Products,” <em class="emphasis">JCK Magazine</em>, June 4, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jckonline.com/2011/06/04/jck-las-vegas-consumers-want-sustainable-products">http://www.jckonline.com/2011/06/04/jck-las-vegas-consumers-want-sustainable-products</a>.</span> Consumer demand for ethical jewelry is increasing sales for products, such as recycled gold and conflict-free-certified diamonds.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p07">“Conflict” diamonds, also known as “blood” diamonds, are defined by the United Nations as those that originate from areas controlled by forces opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments. Angola and Sierra Leone in Africa are examples of two countries that are sources of conflict diamonds. Diamonds have often been used by rebel forces in these countries to finance arms purchases and other illegal activities. Conflict-free diamonds do not look any different from conflict diamonds but have proof of origination showing that were produced in more peaceful regions of the world.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p08">Ethical jewelry is an example of how consumer concern for sustainable products is transforming the offerings from the jewelry industry. By customers “voting” with their purchases they are supporting conflict-free diamonds, which helps reduce a source of funding available to rebel forces with the expectation that this will either shorten wars or prevent their occurrence.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p09">Organizations also need to prepare for anticipated regulation and new government measures related to environmental and social impact. Governments continue to pass legislation to change or end business practices that are harmful to the environment, consumers, or employees. Governments also provide programs and incentives to support voluntary efforts by business to improve their impacts on the community and the environment. The role of government in driving sustainability in businesses is discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch03#gittell_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Government, Public Policy, and Sustainable Business"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p10">The response by many businesses has been an increase in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transparency</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to openness, communication, and accountability. For sustainable businesses, it involves ready access to important information about an organization’s economic, ecological, and social impacts.</span></span> on the reporting of the economic, ecological, and social impacts of their activities. This allows for credibility and operational integrity in a company’s business activities. Businesses need to clearly communicate the positive and measurable impact that they have on all the stakeholders impacted by their operations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p11">Triple bottom line (TBL) reporting, also known as sustainability reporting, has emerged as the primary vehicle to communicate this information from businesses to stakeholders. This type of reporting goes beyond profit (financial) information and discloses the planet (environmental) and people (social) impact of a business. Sustainability reporting is a tool to communicate to society the actions a company is undertaking to fulfill its broad responsibilities to society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p12">A goal of sustainability reporting at the society level is to identify uneconomic growth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Uneconomic growth</a><span class="glossdef">A concept from human welfare economics and is economic growth that results in a decline in the quality of life.</span></span> is a concept from human welfare economics and is economic growth that results in a decline in the quality of life. Only measuring financial activity would not identify uneconomic growth, but with the inclusion of social and environmental performance, stakeholders have a better indication of the quality of economic activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p13">Quite often sustainability reporting is driven not only by external stakeholder forces but by the internal core values of the companies. Some companies are founded by social entrepreneurs who want to incorporate aspects of social change or environmental stewardship into their business operations. Sustainability reporting provides a way of documenting efforts by these organizations and communicating that to customers and other stakeholders. Some companies hope that by publicly disclosing successes and failures related to their sustainability initiatives that they can provide lessons learned to help other companies become more sustainable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p14">Businesses are facing new risks that need to be managed and this is leading them to actively manage their sustainability profile. Resource depletion, increased toxicity, and climate change are all examples of risks that can decrease profitability through either increased cost or decreased revenue. Sustainability reporting can help a company measure and quantify its economic risk associated with different environmental or social threats that may be overlooked in traditional financial reporting. At the same time, all of these factors provide for new business opportunities, and the companies that can successfully manage their businesses from a sustainability perspective can build competitive advantage, mitigate risk, and capitalize on innovation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s00_p15">Currently, larger-size companies, such as Ford, are leading efforts in sustainability reporting as they have greater financial resources available to cover the additional costs of sustainability reporting. It can be challenging for smaller companies to replicate the efforts of the largest and most resourceful companies. These larger company efforts in sustainability reporting, which are the focus of this chapter, provide examples of the types of information that could be useful for businesses of all sizes to report on and provide details about processes that business of all sizes can establish in sustainability reporting.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p01">How do an organization and its stakeholders know how “sustainable” it is? This is not an easy question to answer. As all human activity have economic, social, and ecological impact, it is very difficult to determine whether the sum of the total impact of all activities of a company makes it “sustainable” or “unsustainable.” A more useful approach is to consider an organization’s actions on a continuum with a goal of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">continuous improvement</a><span class="glossdef">A management philosophy of ongoing effort in improving an organization’s products, services, or processes. Often improvement is based on many incremental changes as opposed to radical overhaul.</span></span> in decreasing its negative overall societal impact and improving its positive overall societal impact. Any change in any organization can be challenging to implement, and viewing business operations from a triple bottom line perspective—especially in organizations that typically have been only financially focused—can be extremely challenging. Progressive and small changes when approaching sustainability often will be a more effective strategy than implementing more widespread changes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p02">There is an axiom in business that “you can only manage what you measure.” Measurement is at the core of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performance-based management</a><span class="glossdef">A systematic approach to improving the effectiveness of an organization through an ongoing process of measurement, collection, review, analysis, action, and communication.</span></span>. This statement is true whether the business is a small sole proprietorship or a large multinational company.

It is only in recent years that the business community has shifted to additional metrics—in terms of environmental and societal impact—to assess their business performance. Over the past decade, sustainability reporting has been increasingly adopted by corporations worldwide. In 2008, nearly 80 percent of the largest 250 companies worldwide issued some form of reporting that incorporated environmental or societal impact; this is up over 50 percent from 2005.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_005">KPMG, <em class="emphasis">KPMG International Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting 2008</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kpmg.com/EU/en/Documents/KPMG_International_survey_Corporate_responsibility_Survey_Reporting_2008.pdf">http://www.kpmg.com/EU/en/Documents/KPMG_International_survey_Corporate_responsibility_Survey_Reporting_2008.pdf</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p11">One of the most important aspects of sustainability reporting is the communication of the information so that it can be evaluated by stakeholders. For most businesses, the most visible form of sustainability information communication is in their annual corporate sustainability report. This has become an increasingly common document released by major companies and is typically featured on their websites. Many companies will have a section of their website specifically dedicated to highlighting their initiatives and outcomes relating to sustainability. Sustainability information can be included on consumer packaging or other marketing pieces to help brand the sustainability efforts of the company and assist consumer choice.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p13">While metrics are important, quantitative information is only one aspect of sustainability reporting; what is also important is qualitative information that provides context for a company’s sustainability efforts and discussion of how sustainability integrates into an organization’s short-term and long-term mission and business activities.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p14">Sustainability reporting can be challenging. Sustainability efforts can be difficult for organizations for reasons including</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_l03">
            <li>lack of internal expertise and understanding of sustainability,</li>

            <li>the need to coordinate across various functional units within an organization, and</li>
            <li>lack of a clear vision and management strategy in regards to sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p15">Information systems, labor, and other organizational resources must be devoted to measuring and analyzing sustainability information. In addition, sustainability is a complex topic and reporting on specific economic, ecological, and social metrics that are quantifiable may not be sufficient to give a full picture of a company’s “true” societal impact.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p16">One of the greatest challenges for businesses is the actual collection, compilation, and validation of data necessary for sustainability reporting. Businesses need to collect information in an accurate and timely manner and business processes must be in place to compile and analyze collected sustainability data.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_p17">But even if an organization has the best data collection systems in place and a robust and accurate sustainability reporting process, organizations must also act on that information—that is, use the information to inform and influence subsequent actions. This leads to the next major challenge, which is integrating the information collected and analyzed into the management decision-making process. It is not beneficial to produce a great sustainability report and then stick it on a shelf or a website. A business must be able to “sense” its external environment through effective data acquisition and reports, and it must be able to learn from what it perceives from that information to improve its practices using that information.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p02">Radical transparency is a voluntary transparency that exceeds what is required by law or regulation and involves providing a clear picture to the public of “the good, the bad, and the ugly” about the company. Sustainability reporting is one component of radical transparency as it allows a more public and honest view of the company. Radical transparency is based on the concept that the truth is far easier to sustain than hidden information or a lie. The belief is that customers and other stakeholders will want to engage and support organizations that are built on full disclosure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p03">Radical transparency has been supported by the rise of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and other forms of Internet-based communication that expose the truth and that can provide a low-cost way to reach a global audience with information.</p>

The cereal markets its products as natural and healthy. But customers felt betrayed when they learned that genetically modified soy was being used in the product but was not disclosed by Kashi. Social media, including Facebook and Twitter, allowed customers to immediately and with great impact express their outrage as many of Kashi’s customers believe genetically modified food products are not healthy. Kashi’s callous initial response did little to appease customers as David Desouza, Kashi’s general manager, stated they had done nothing wrong as “the FDA has chosen not to regulate the term ‘natural.’”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_007">“The Kashi GMO Controversy: Will You Stop Buying the Crunchy Cereals?,” Well &amp; Good NYC, May 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wellandgoodnyc.com/2012/05/01/the-kashi-gmo-controversy-will-you-stop-buying-the-crunchy-cereals/">http://www.wellandgoodnyc.com/2012/05/01/the-kashi-gmo-controversy-will-you-stop-buying-the-crunchy-cereals/</a>.</span> The rise of social media has allowed anyone to gain the attention of the world and highlights the companies to be aware of potential “firestorms” that can arise from customers posts; however, had Kashi been transparent about their use of this product and engaged their customers on their products—through social media and open dialog—they could have not only avoided alienating their customers but also built better relationships and trust with their customers.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p05">In contrast to Kashi’s failure to be transparent, Seventh Generation provides an example of how being transparent can build customer relationships. Jeffrey Hollender, cofounder of Seventh Generation, posted a list on the company’s website several years ago of all the things that were wrong with their products and how they fell short of what the company’s mission, which is to “restore the environment, inspire conscious consumption and create a just and equitable world.” The list included packaging that compromised their values and use of certain less-desirable ingredients because they were unable to use preferable alternatives.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p06">Jeff’s sales manager was concerned that this level of transparency would be exploited by their competitors leading to a loss in market share and revenue. In fact, competitors did provide their customers with the list of Seventh Generation’s shortcomings. However, competitors’ customers did not use this information against Seventh Generation, but instead they asked Seventh Generation’s competitors to now share their own list. Most competitors were not willing to do this. This level of radical transparency resulted in Seventh Generation’s customer loyalty becoming even stronger. The bottom line, according to Hollender, is that “you can’t judge your own level of sustainability or responsibility, you can only be judged by others.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_008">R.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_p01">The process for sustainability reporting is similar to all performance-based business management processes. It involves the same steps, including goal setting, measurement, analysis, and action, but differs in the type of information collected. As with any business initiative, it is essential that management be supportive—in this case of sustainability—and that management provides the necessary financial, technical, and human resources to support each step of the process. The success of sustainability reporting depends on the commitment of the senior management in the organization.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_p02">Information technology is a major consideration in sustainability reporting. Businesses should be prepared to effectively manage the large amount of information related to sustainability and need to have information systems that can help to integrate sustainability information into their existing corporate reporting systems. These information systems must be designed to communicate performance metrics to decision makers throughout the organization. Large corporate software vendors, such as SAP and Oracle, which provide traditional business software, have integrated sustainability modules that help businesses with measuring their social and environmental performance data. In addition, a variety of custom software applications are available to assist businesses with measuring their environmental and social impact.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Define Performance Goals and Metrics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The first step is to define the sustainability goals of the company. This is an important action and should guide the rest of the process. While sustainability reporting is meant to be broad and comprehensive to provide a full “360 degree” view of the company or documentation of the complete ecological and societal impact of a company, it must be bound at a level that is pragmatic and appropriately focused for a company. Typically resource limitations will require a company to take a phased in approach where it focuses on the areas of higher impact and importance and gradually expands to areas of lower impact and importance. Organizations should put their resources into collecting the information that is most relevant to their sustainability efforts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p02">The company should have an overall vision of why it wants to integrate sustainability efforts into its business operations. Is the goal of the company to “change the world”? Or is it more simply to document the company’s progress on environmental and social impacts? Is the audience for the reporting internal, external, or both? A company will need to evaluate whether its focus is on continuous improvement in its own individual actions or if it is measuring its performance relative to a broader target, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p03">The next step is to develop key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure progress toward those goals. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key performance indicator</a><span class="glossdef">A performance measure that companies collect to track the success of a particular activity.</span></span> is a performance measure from operational data that is used by organizations to track a particular activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p04">There are different methods for establishing KPIs, but one typical method is the SMART criteria. In SMART, a measure has a <strong class="emphasis bold">s</strong>pecific business purpose and is <strong class="emphasis bold">m</strong>easurable, <strong class="emphasis bold">a</strong>chievable, and <strong class="emphasis bold">r</strong>elevant to the success of the organization and can be measured over a specific period of <strong class="emphasis bold">t</strong>ime.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p05">Companies need to take into account their financial, human, and information technology resources when selecting KPIs. Data collection cost must be factored into performance metric selection. This includes the availability of data and cost to integrate into existing information systems and existing business processes. For some metrics, the business cost may be too high to justify the changes necessary to collect the data required.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p06">In sustainability reporting, a KPI is referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sustainable performance indicator (SPI)</a><span class="glossdef">A metric that measures an economic, social, or ecological performance area in a business. See <a class="xref" href="gittell_1.0-ch05#gittell_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Sustainable Business"</a> for a more detailed discussion.</span></span>. SPIs are used as a tool to measure a company’s sustainability performance and to monitor and report on future progress. SPIs can be further categorized into the three areas covering either the economic, ecological, or social aspects of sustainability.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p07">For example, a company may select annual net income, annual workplace accidents, and annual water usage as SPIs. Annual net income is an economic performance indicator to measure the financial progress of the company. Annual workplace accidents are a social performance indicator to measure a company’s progress in providing a safe work environment for its employees. Annual water usage is an ecological performance indicator to record the progress a company is making in reducing water usage as a way of protecting the environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p08">Goal and SPI selection can become overwhelming to an organization given the wide reach of sustainability reporting; fortunately, there are well-developed resources available on sustainability goals and metrics. Companies do not need to “reinvent the wheel” in regards to performance indicator selection. Common sustainability frameworks are available (discussed later in the chapter) that can help companies choose important SPIs. Companies can also contract with consultants who specialize in sustainability reporting to assist with prioritization and goal establishment.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p09">Annual organizational energy use is one of the most common SPIs in sustainability reporting. GHG emissions, another very common SPI, can be calculated from energy usage. Utility bills, such as natural gas or electricity, are the typical data source for energy use. Utility bills provide both cost and quantity of fuel consumed during the billing period (typically one month). Organizations typically are already recording energy cost information into their financial information systems but usually do not enter any information on the amount of energy used.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p10">Information on energy used is necessary to calculate an annual energy use SPI. Therefore organizations interested in tracking energy and GHG emission information need to modify their business processes and information systems to not only collect energy consumption information. Organizations should take into account the cost and effort required to modify business processes to accommodate the new data requirements when deciding what SPIs to measure.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p11">SPIs can be used in determining the projects that a business undertakes. Under traditional business finance, a project—such as the purchase of a new piece of equipment—would be considered using financial measures, such as payback or return on investment. SPIs can be used to calculate a sustainable return on investment (SROI). SROI determines the full value of a project by assigning monetary values to environmental and social indicators. This allows for the calculation of full costs and benefits of a project to be evaluated and may result in approving projects that would fail traditional financial tests or in not moving forward with projects even though their traditional financial measures would support the project.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measure Performance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">Once SPIs are established and business processes are modified to allow for the necessary data to be captured and recorded, the process of measurement begins. Data needs to be collected, validated for accuracy, and stored (typically using database technology or computer spreadsheets). Data collection processes must be straightforward and data must be collected systematically and consistently. Sometimes multiple data sources may be required to offset limitations in any one source of data.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p02">In this phase, it is important to assign responsibility of data collection to ensure that it is being collected correctly. This includes quality control to ensure that data are accurate. For example, errors in measurement devices or communication can lead to false data being collected. As the popular saying goes, “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Garbage in, garbage out,</a><span class="glossdef">A common saying in business reflecting that the quality of an analysis is only as good as the information that is used in the analysis.</span></span>” which means that that the quality of the analysis is only as accurate or insightful as the quality of the information analyzed.</p>

Key components of the evaluation phase are data compilation, data analysis, and communication. The evaluation phase includes organizing, synthesizing, and aggregating data.

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_p01">Data analysis can include a variety of techniques including database-driven reporting, spreadsheet analysis, and statistical tests. A business analyst is typically involved in managing this aspect of the sustainable reporting process, and they require both business and technical skills to perform their job. Often the data analysis involves looking for trends when analyzing SPIs. It can also include comparing performance with a goal or standard or to competitors or peers? This typically involves comparing a performance measure to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">baseline</a><span class="glossdef">The initial level of performance at which an organization, process, or function is operating upon which future performance will be measured.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_p02">While there are many different tools and techniques that can be applied to analyze data and SPIs, two that have specific relevance to sustainability reporting are normalization and benchmarking.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Normalization</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Normalization</a><span class="glossdef">A process in data analysis where factors that impact a KPI are removed to allow for insightful comparison and evaluation.</span></span> is the process of removing the impact of factors that may influence direct comparison of SPIs. For example, weather impacts the energy use of a building and varies from year to year. Frequently, an annual energy use SPI will be normalized for weather (e.g., controlled for the coldness of a winter season) to allow for relevant comparison of energy use from one year to the next.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_s01_p02">Another frequent application of normalization for companies is to document GHG emissions on the basis of unit of output rather than an absolute number. Growing companies with increasing activities may have rising absolute GHG emissions, even as they are successfully taking actions to reduce their environmental impact on a per unit or consumption basis. Normalizing GHG emissions for output, such as pounds of CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> per unit produced, can highlight the impact of companies efforts to reduce energy that otherwise would be masked by just considering absolute emissions. Other examples of factors that can be normalized for include the occupancy level in a hotel, volume of sales at a retail location, square feet of a building, or number of employees at an office.</p>

This can help an organization gauge the potential and success of its sustainability efforts relative to other companies in their industry and peer organizations. In the process of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">benchmarking</a><span class="glossdef">A process of comparing an organization’s business process and performance measures to industry best practices.</span></span>, the best firms in a company’s industry or industries with similar business processes are targeted, and the company then compares its own results and processes with the results and processes of the targeted organizations. This provides insight into how well the organization compares to an industry’s top performers and can provide insight into the business processes and practices that explain why these firms are the “best.” Benchmarking can also include assessing an organization’s relative position to that of other organizations. Is an SPI below average, average, or above average? For example, a company may use benchmarking to see how its GHG emissions compare with those of other companies in its industry. If a company’s emissions are above average, it would indicate that they have the potential to reduce their emissions. The business benefit is that—as GHG emissions are linked to energy usage—the company has potential cost savings by implementing measures to reduce its energy consumption.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p01">The final step in the evaluation process is communicating analyzed information so that stakeholders can understand and learn how a company is performing in relation to its sustainability efforts. The information communicated is different depending on the target audience for the information. Management would look for information in a different format than would an investor, consumer, or other stakeholder.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p02">Communication outside of the company through company websites, annual sustainability reports, and other forms of disclosure about organizations environmental and social performance has become standard business practice. There is no universal method of external communication of sustainability performance, although many standards do exist. The trend in sustainability reporting has been moving toward standardized reporting using frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) or the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), discussed later in this chapter. Standards allow for meaningful comparisons between sustainability information reported by different organizations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p03">Reporting should include a meaningful assessment of environmental and social risks as well as an analysis of past sustainability performance and an outlook for the future. Reports should communicate performance both quantitatively and qualitatively and should communicate sustainability information in a way that represents a complete and accurate picture of the organization. While not required, it is common for information reported to be independently verified. Independent verification and standards assist with accountability, as public reporting is typically voluntary and helps reduce the potential for organizations to misuse sustainability reporting, such as for “green washing.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_s03_p01">Registries are organizations that allow companies, government agencies, and other organizations to report sustainability information. Reporting to registries can be voluntary or mandatory depending on the laws applying to the organization; however, at this time, most registries are voluntary. Typically registries have involved environmental reporting, specifically GHG emissions, but registries can be a way for companies to report both social and environmental performance measures. Examples of GHG registries include the Climate Registry, CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, Climate Disclosure Project (CDP), National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System (NGER), and Electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_s03_p02">To participate in a registry, an organization must join the registry. Some registries are free while others charge a fee to be a member. Registries provide guidelines about the type of information that they collect and protocols for data submission. Some registries require that the information submitted by an organization be independently verified by a third party. Registries may also provide the opportunity for companies to benchmark their SPIs with those of other companies that are using the registry. Registries can include some form of award or recognition program. Registries range from small to large in terms of membership, and some have relatively simple reporting requirements while others have more sophisticated reporting requirements.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_s03_p03">An example of a small-scale voluntary program is Maryland’s Green Registry.

                <li>Sustainability reporting is based on performance-based management and is a cycle to promote continuous improvement.</li>
                <li>There are four steps in the sustainability reporting process: (1) define performance goals and metrics, (2) measure performance, (3) evaluate performance, and (4) manage performance.</li>
                <li>Companies need to take into account their financial, human, and information technology resources when selecting SPIs. Management must be supportive of integrating sustainability reporting into business operations and be prepared to act on information learned from the reporting.</li>
                <li>SPIs are used as a tool to measure a company’s sustainability performance and to monitor and report on future progress. SPIs are categorized into economic, ecological, and social.</li>
                <li>Annual reports, eco-labels, benchmarking, and balanced score cards are examples of tools and techniques used in sustainability reporting.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">Voluntary frameworks or guidelines have emerged to help businesses determine how to report on their sustainability performance. These tools provide structure that can help businesses get started with sustainability reporting or help businesses that are already reporting on sustainable performance improve or expand their reporting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_p02">There are many different sustainability reporting guidelines and frameworks for businesses to choose among. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is one of the most common and encompasses the three spheres of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. In this section, the GRI G3 Sustainability Guidelines will be discussed in greatest detail to help the reader understand the type of information in a reporting framework.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Reporting Initiative</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was started in 1997 by the NGO the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies (Ceres) and today collaborates as an independent entity with the United Nations Environmental Program and the UN Secretary General’s Global Compact. Ceres developed the Global Reporting Initiative to help companies report sustainability performance in a similar way as financial information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p02">The GRI provides a consistent way for companies to voluntarily measure and report progress on economic, ecological, and social performance of their businesses. In 2009, 1,400 GRI based reports were registered by reporting entities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p03">GRI first released the guidelines in 2000, and the current version, G3, was published in 2006. The framework is continuously improved as knowledge of sustainability issues evolves and the priorities of reporters and report users change. In March 2011, GRI released the G3.1 guidelines (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/guidelines-online/G31Online/Pages/default.aspx">https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/guidelines-online/G31Online/Pages/default.aspx</a>), which is an update and revision to the G3 guidelines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p04">The G3.1 guidelines provide seventy-nine performance indicators. Fifty of these indicators are “core” and twenty-nine are “additional.”</p>

        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p04">Fair trade (a.k.a. Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is an alternative approach to conventional trade. Fair trade offers producers (such as small coffee bean farmers) improved terms of trade. This provides producers with additional income by paying a “fair” amount for the commodity they produce. A commodity is a marketable item produced in significant quantities. Examples include agricultural products (corn, soybeans, etc.), metals (gold, iron, etc.), and fuel (coal, oil, etc.). Fair trade offers consumers a powerful way to reduce poverty through their everyday shopping.</p>

Many farming communities in the <em class="emphasis">developing</em> world now benefit from fairer terms of trade. The Fair Trade Certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, oranges, cocoa, coffee, shortbread, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. In 2009, Fair Trade Certified sales amounted to $4.8 billion worldwide up 15 percent from the previous year. Fair trade distributed an additional $74 million for community development. It is estimated that six million people directly benefit from fair trade.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_012">“Facts and Figures,” Fairtrade International, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html">http://www.fairtrade.net/facts_and_figures.html</a>.</span></p>

LEED is an internationally recognized environmental building certification system that was developed by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) in 2000. According to the US Department of Energy, buildings use 39 percent of the energy and 74 percent of the electricity produced each year in the United States; therefore, efforts to improve building sustainability can have a significant impact.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p07">Organizations that are constructing new buildings or renovating building can use the LEED sustainable building design program. The organization can pick and choose different sustainable practices to undertake (although some projects are required for certification) and earn points for those projects. Organizations participate in LEED certification for a variety of reasons, including to help brand their organization as sustainable and to reduce building operational cost.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p08">Up to one hundred points is possible in the LEED 2009 Certification for New Construction and Major Renovations with different levels of certification possible based on the total number of points. If a project achieves forty points and meets all minimum requirements, it will be certified. The next level up is silver certification if fifty minimum points are achieved. The next highest level is gold certified, and the highest possible level is platinum certification.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p10">The company recently expanded their corporate campus by160,000 square feet, but even with the expansion, Johnson Controls has been able to reduce their energy use by 21 percent. Additionally, the company has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 375 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and reduced its water use by 600,000 gallons annually. These reductions were achieved using on-site solar electricity generation, a rainwater collection, and a recycling system.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p11">Employees have control over the temperature, lighting, airflow, and ambient noise levels at their individual workspaces. And if they’re not at their workspace for ten minutes or more, their individual environmental systems are automatically shut off to save energy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s04_p12">“As a company that’s been in the energy efficiency business for 125 years, we believe it was important to set an example and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating the latest green technologies, including many of our own, into a multibuilding campus setting,” said Stephen A. Roell, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson Controls. “We’re delighted that the US Green Building Council has recognized our efforts with its highest award of LEED Platinum certification. Hopefully, it will encourage others to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of their properties, be it for one building or several.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p01">Sustainability involves taking a holistic perspective to understand the true short-term and long-term impacts of a business activity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Life cycle</a><span class="glossdef">A view of a process from its beginning to its end.</span></span> thinking has emerged as a useful tool in sustainability to consider the total impacts of an activity, product, or service from its origin to its end. This differs from conventional business practices in which the focus has traditionally been on more immediate factors, such as cost, quality, and availability in the supply chain. Life cycle thinking still takes into account these factors but considers them over a product’s lifetime. While conventional business practices have given limited consideration to disposal costs, life cycle thinking considers the impacts of disposal to be an important part of the overall process of product or service provision.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p02">Life cycle thinking in a business context considers business activities using a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cradle to grave</a><span class="glossdef">A term used in life cycle thinking that represents the consideration of a specific entity or activity from the process of activities leading to its inception to its disposal.</span></span>” perspective. Cradle to grave starts by considering the impacts of raw material extraction and other inputs. It considers transportation of inputs to the organization and the impacts of the transformation process into a useful product or service that occur at the organization. It then considers transportation from the organization through the use of the product or service up to the ultimate disposal. Each step in the life cycle features a specific focus on inputs and outputs, such as raw materials and waste.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_p03">Life cycle thinking came into attention in the 1960s, when life-cycle-based accounting was first used to account for environmental emissions and economic costs associated with various energy technologies over their life cycle. Life cycle thinking has evolved as a sophisticated method for businesses to consider their environmental and social impacts.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Life Cycle Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p01">The management philosophy that integrates a comprehensive life cycle approach for organizations in managing their value chain is called life cycle management (LCM). A value chain is the connected activities that an organization undertakes in providing a product or service, with each interconnected activity adding value. LCM is a systematic progress of organizing, analyzing, and managing of sustainability impacts throughout the entire life cycle of a product, process, or activity. LCM can occur at the product or service level or at the entire company level. For example, a company may be interested in managing the life cycle of one of its products to improve sustainability, or it may take a more comprehensive look at the portfolio of activities that it engages in as part of a more far-reaching approach to sustainability. One of the key benefits of life cycle management is that it can alert management to potential “hot spots,” or areas that may be ecologically or socially problematic.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p02">So how might LCM play out in real life? For example, if a company is selecting raw materials for the production of a product, they may have several material options to consider. The company can have a goal of choosing materials that have a higher degree of sustainability, meaning less negative societal impact or greater positive societal impact.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p03">For example, if a product could be produced with three pounds of plastic material or two pounds of wood material, which material selection would result in lower pollution emissions per unit of product produced? Which would use less water? The impacts may vary depending on what other materials are required; for example, wood may require paint, while plastic would not. What about the quality of labor conditions for where the wood is harvested versus where the plastic was produced?</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Materials that do not have environmental and social impact do not exist; every material has some form of impact. LCM can be used to manage for ecologically and socially preferable products and services.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Phases of a Life Cycle</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p01">The following figure illustrates three key phases in a life cycle. Cradle is the resource extraction or impacts of elements that serve as inputs to the process. Throughout the business activity or process, there are inputs and outputs, including water, energy, emissions, and waste. Upon completion of the activity, the finished output of the activity is at the gate. The gate is the defining point when a business output activity is completed and it moves beyond the organization to the next step in its life cycle. For example, the gate at a factory that produces tablet PCs is when the manufactured tablet is boxed and ready to be shipped from the factory. Between the gate and up until the grave is the active use phase of the output of the organization, with the grave being the ultimate disposal of the output.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p02">Two terms that are associated with the life cycle are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">upstream</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of the value chain that plays a role in the supply chain of the producing organization. This can include extraction and transportation of raw materials.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">downstream</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of the value chain that plays a role in a later step in the product life cycle past the producing organization itself. This can include the distribution, use, or disposal of goods.</span></span> processes. Upstream refers to activities occurring before the organization (supply chain) and downstream refers to activities occurring after the organization (product distribution and product use and disposal). Upstream and downstream can also be in reference to a specific point in the life cycle. For example, a company might be interested in the impacts of all activities “upstream” of a specific supplier. While business life cycles frequently are focused on products or tangible goods, it can also apply to services.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p03">Life cycle management does not need to consider the entire life cycle, but instead, it can consider discrete phases or parts. This depends on the needs of the organization. Sometimes, the greatest opportunities for reducing environmental or social impacts may exist outside a company’s own operations and in its supply chain, in which case, life cycle management would focus on its supply chain. Or the assembly of a product might be quite complex, and life cycle management is focused on one specific part of the assembly process.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p04">Different types of life cycle management include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Cradle to grave includes the whole product life cycle from beginning to disposal.</li>
                <li>Cradle to gate focuses on the phase from input extraction through the organization output, but not downstream impact.</li>
                <li>Cradle to cradle specifically focuses on the end-of-life step being recycling. This type of life cycle management is becoming more in focus where considerable attention is paid in designing products so that they can become part of another beneficial use and not be disposed of as waste.</li>

                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p04">One sustainable performance indicator (SPI) that could be used in life cycle thinking is to consider the total energy used in the production of a product. A 500-calorie cheeseburger requires about 1,700 calories of energy from oil and electricity to make it from the farm to the finished product at a restaurant. This means that it takes more energy to make a burger than we receive from eating the burger. This negative energy flow and its dependence on fossil fuels has its own implications for the sustainability of eating cheeseburgers, but from the restaurant owner perspective, they would be most interested in the areas where changes to their business practices would have the most impact in reducing energy use.</p>
                <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p05">One option for the restaurant owner is to consider which ingredients of the burger have the greatest energy impact in their life cycle. Almost 80 percent of the energy in a cheeseburger comes from all the steps associated with producing, preparing, and cooking of the hamburger meat. This would be an area for the restaurant owner to focus on. Cheese and bread are also two ingredients that require a significant amount of energy in the cheeseburger life cycle.</p>

The area with the biggest impact on the energy use of a cheeseburger is agricultural activities, or the activities that occur at the farm. This suggests that the biggest impacts on energy use that a restaurant owner can make actually occur in his supply chain and not at his own facility. This might be a finding that the owner may never have expected or have known about without considering his operations from a life cycle perspective. Only about 10 percent of the energy in the entire cheeseburger life cycle is generated on-site in the cooking of the burger; the other 90 percent comes from various upstream activities.</p>

Scope one consists of direct emissions from an organization’s operations. An example of scope one would be emissions from fuel consumed to heat a building. Scope two emissions are emissions from energy purchased by the organization that are generated outside of the organization. Typically, this would be the emissions from power plants for the electricity used by an organization. Scope three emissions are emissions from sources outside of the organization but related to an organization’s business activities. Supplier emissions and emissions related to transportation not directly owned by the organization would fall under scope three emissions.</p>

The water footprint is an indicator of water use that looks at both direct and indirect water use. A product or corporate water footprint is the first step toward identifying the processes and activities, which significantly influence an organization’s water use. The water footprint of a product (good or service) is the volume of fresh water used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the value chain. The water footprint of a business consists of its direct water use for producing, manufacturing, and supporting activities plus its indirect water use—that is, the water used in the business’s supply chain.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_018">Institute for Water Education, <em class="emphasis">Water Neutral: Reducing and Offsetting the Impacts of Water Footprints</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report28-WaterNeutral.pdf">http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report28-WaterNeutral.pdf</a>.</span></p>

Walmart’s goal is to communicate to customers the safety, quality, and social responsibility of the products they purchase from Walmart.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p08">The first step in developing the sustainability index has been to analyze the impact of their supply chain. This upstream analysis has involved surveying and scoring suppliers according to a fifteen-question supplier sustainability assessment. These questions are divided into four categories: (1) energy and climate, (2) material efficiency, (3) nature and resources, and (4) people and community. Walmart provided more than one hundred thousand global suppliers with the brief survey to evaluate their own sustainability, and the survey was required to be completed by their top-tier suppliers.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p09">The next steps in their development of a sustainability index are to develop a life cycle analysis database for products and to develop a simple tool to communicate sustainability performance from suppliers to customers.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn04_022">“Sustainability Index,” Walmart, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://walmartstores.com/sustainability/9292.aspx">http://walmartstores.com/sustainability/9292.aspx</a>.</span></p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s06_p01">Sustainability reporting builds on existing business management tools and concepts and applies them in a broader context in response to a complex and highly interactive social, environmental, and economic environment. It builds on conventional business management techniques—such as key performance indicators—but applies them with a focus on triple bottom line and life cycle management. It requires a sophisticated approach of integrating nonfinancial, sustainable performance measures into the traditional reporting of an organization.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s06_p02">The challenge of sustainability for business organizations is to extract value from sustainability reporting so that it constructively guides and transforms their business operations. Sustainability reporting without strategic purpose may result in information that is nice to know; costly to obtain; and of little benefit to the company, the environment, or society.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s06_p03">Sustainability reporting in the hands of a proactive organization that learns, adapts, and continuously improves can give a competitive advantage in dealing with the challenging environment that businesses face. Sustainability reporting allows companies to identify business risks or “hot spots” that were previously undetected and also to alert management to business opportunities related to new markets, products, and services.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s06_p04">While sustainability reporting is still maturing, there is considerable guidance and expertise available to help guide management in incorporating sustainable practices into their organizations. The tools, frameworks, and guidelines discussed in this chapter can assist a company in its progression to sustainability.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch04_s06_p05">The resources needed to implement aspects of sustainability reporting can be significant. Therefore many of the concepts in this chapter are most relevant for medium and large businesses and can be particularly challenging to smaller organizations. Many of the tools and processes discussed in this chapter are geared toward small, incremental change as a part of continuous improvement. All businesses, small or large, new or mature, can implement aspects of sustainability reporting into their organization to achieve improved operating results while minimizing negative societal impacts and emphasizing positive societal impacts.</p>
