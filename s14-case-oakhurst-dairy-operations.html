Oakhurst Dairy is a featured CA–CP Co-op Planet Corporate Partner. See <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/about/partners.php">http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/about/partners.php</a>.</span> In the process of its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">carbon footprint mapping</a><span class="glossdef">Process to identify and describe the level and intensity of carbon emissions for an activity, process, operation, enterprise, individual, animal, or other carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>e) activity or process.</span></span> the company identified how to reduce its GHG <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emissions</a><span class="glossdef">Pollution released by residential, commercial, and industrial facilities.</span></span> and also identified innovative ways to improve operational efficiencies, reduce operational costs (mostly energy costs), and enhance profits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Oakhurst Dairy has changed over time. The long established northern New England dairy company no longer owns any dairy farms. It makes its money by processing milk bought from dairy farms. It owns no cows. It buys its raw milk from local dairy farmers and sells its processed milk to grocery stores and retailers such as Walmart and 7-Eleven.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s01_p03">The company, under the Bennett family ownership, has become one of northern New England’s largest independent milk processors. Oakhurst’s approach is to build brand equity and increase profits over time. This has been supported by investing in operation management practices that reduce costs and increase brand awareness and loyalty with the dissemination of information about the company’s practices that reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s01_p04">Oakhurst’s sustainable business approach includes (a) senior management commitment to sustainable business practices in its operations and its supply chain, (b) integration of sustainable goals and practices in the company’s business systems, (c) use of operating and financial reports and communications, and (d) monitoring of environmental results and implementation of continuous improvements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s01_p05">This case will highlight how the company, by adopting sustainable business practices throughout its operations, saved more than $620,000 in annual fuel costs. These are savings that have contributed directly to Oakhurst’s financial bottom line. This includes savings from a $343,000 investment in solar panels at two of its facilities, resulting in annual savings of $52,500 (at a fuel cost of $3.50 per gallon) and representing a 6.5 year payback period on their investment. With an estimated life of thirty years, the solar panel investment alone will save Oakhurst $1.2 million over the life of the solar panels and lower its carbon emissions by 176 metric tons annually.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">The founding family of Oakhurst, the Bennett family, has managed a successful dairy business based out of Portland, Maine, for ninety years. This is not a simple accomplishment. The dairy industry is dynamic and fiercely competitive, and Oakhurst has become the largest independent dairy processor in northern New England. The company is privately owned and as such its financial information is not publically available. Much of the information from this case is garnered from company interviews and a study of the company by Clean Air–Cool Planet (CA–CP).<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_002">“Outreach and Education/Resources,” Clean Air–Cool Planet, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/climate_preparedness/outreach_ed.php">http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/climate_preparedness/outreach_ed.php</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p02">Instead of succumbing to the external economic and political forces that have reduced many family businesses to nostalgic memories of bucolic America, the Bennett family found ways to keep the dairy industry a part of the Maine economy. Oakhurst’s success can be attributed in part to the company’s strategy, built on the following:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p05">The Bennett family firmly believed that the well-being of their company and the US dairy industry were dependent on environmental stewardship. Oakhurst’s proactive and interactive approach to reducing emissions has set the standard for best practices in the dairy industry. They have collaborated with interest groups, government agencies, industry competitors, and others in their sustainability efforts.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_005">See Clean Air–Cool Planet, <em class="emphasis">Taking All the Right Steps: A Maine Dairy Reduces Its Carbon Footprint</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/information/pdf/Oakhurst%20Dairy%20Case%20Study%2001272009.pdf">http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/information/pdf/Oakhurst%20Dairy%20Case%20Study%2001272009.pdf</a>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p07">Under Bill’s leadership, Oakhurst has focused on ways to boost operational efficiency in the highly competitive dairy industry. With price pressure intense in the industry, success at reducing costs without sacrificing product quality and integrity could contribute to increased profitability. Finding ways to reduce energy, electricity, water, and sewage costs could enhance company profits at the same time it reduced the company’s environmental impact and could enhance its favorable reputation with significant numbers of consumers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p08">On his brother’s passing, Bill stated in the company’s news release, “Oakhurst is where it is today because of Stan’s leadership and foresight; he always kept an eye on the future. For a number of years, we’ve put a lot of thought into making sure we have a caring, experienced, and committed team in place; and this team will continue to lead us well into the future.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_007">Front Burner PR, “Oakhurst’s Bill and John Bennett Well Prepared to Lead Respected New England Dairy,” news release, February 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.frontburnerpr.com/uploads/oak_transition_feb2011_final.pdf">http://www.frontburnerpr.com/uploads/oak_transition_feb2011_final.pdf</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p10">Bill Bennett, reflecting on his brother’s life and contribution to Oakhurst, stated, “The main reason we’ve been so successful over the years is because of him.” Bill added that many of the recent steps the company had taken to decrease its carbon footprint, including purchasing biofuels from a local company that turns restaurant fry oil into biofuel and installing solar panels on the roofs of the company’s various buildings, were because of Stanley Bennett II’s leadership.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_009">“Stanley T.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p11">The challenge for Oakhurst management was to buck the industry trend toward large-scale dairy farming, processing, and distribution through consolidation of dairies while maintaining profitability. According to Bill Bennett II, “Twenty-five or thirty years ago, we were a big dairy in a sea of little dairies. Now we are a small dairy [processor].”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_010">J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p12">Like its counterparts across the country, Maine dairy farmers were finding it difficult to make a profit let alone stay in business. However, compared to its northern New England neighbors, Maine was losing its dairy farms at a lower rate as a result of Maine’s innovative dairy stabilization program (see sidebar “The State of Maine’s Dairy Industry”).</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">The State of Maine’s Dairy Industry</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p13">In 2009, Maine’s dairy industry generated more than $570 million annually for the state’s economy, paid $25 million in state and municipal local taxes, and provided more than four thousand jobs. In the 1950s, Maine had 51,000 herds of dairy cattle. By 2009 it was down to 32,000 cows making 590 million pounds of milk per year (69 million gallons). By 2009 there were 315 dairy farms in Maine ranging in size from 10 to 1,700 cows. In the period from 2000 to 2004, Maine lost 106 farms. Maine has more than sixty milk processors. Six processors package fluid milk for drinking: Oakhurst Dairy, H. P. Hood, Houlton Farms Dairy, Garelick Farms of Maine, Kate’s Butter, and Smiling Hill Farm Dairy. By far the largest was H. P. Hood with $2.4 billion in revenue and 3,000 employees in 2010. Dean’s Foods, a National food and beverage company had revenues of $12.9 billion and lost $1.5 billion (2010). Oakhurst Dairy was the largest privately owned Maine dairy processor with 2010 revenues of $110 million and 250 employees.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p14">Since 2004 the US dairy industry has been marked by two significant factors. The western United States has seen unimagined and unprecedented growth in total milk and average size of each dairy operation. This shift was the result of state and federal government policies that offer financial incentives in the form of tax breaks and subsidies to take unproductive land and convert it to animal agriculture, or convert land from one type of production to dairy production. Secondly, the cyclical “boom-and-bust” dynamic of dairy pricing has continued on a national scale and has become more erratic and extreme. Maine has continued to lose farms, but at a much slower rate than the rest of the Northeast. Some farms have gone out of business because of the age of the farmer or the fact there was no one to take over the farm. Most importantly, the economic impact of the remaining farms has not lost its influence on the state’s economy. Many states have looked to Maine as an innovative leader in the dairy industry, first with the Northeast Dairy Compact and now with the Maine Dairy Stabilization “Tier” Program. Established in 2004, the “Tier” program provides a safety net during periods of historically low national milk prices. In contrast to the overall picture of New England dairy farming, Maine stands out and is considered a success story because of the 2004 dairy stabilization program. Since the start of the program, Maine lost 75 dairy farms, or 19 percent of the industry, in contrast to extreme losses in Vermont (52 percent) and New Hampshire (46 percent). The dairy stabilization program provides a payment from the Maine’s General Fund directly to farmers when the amount that they receive from the marketplace for their milk falls below their cost of production. In Maine, the cost of production is estimated at $25 per hundred weight of milk, while the farmer can receive between $11 and $23 per hundred weight from the marketplace. If the price of milk is high, no payments are made. When it drops, the program assists the farmers. Since 2007, $30 million has been paid to Maine’s dairy farmers through the tier program. According to Julie Marie Bickford of the Maine Dairy Industry Association compared to states without a milk commission, Maine is a relatively healthy dairy state.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s02_p15">Galen Larrabee, a dairy farmer from Knox, Maine noted that even with the tier program it hasn’t been easy for Maine farmers. He noted, feed costs have gone through the barn roof—up by a third over last year at this time. Fuel costs could be doubled by the end of the year. Energy bills—mostly electricity—have been running $6,000 a month. “We spent $730,000 on grain last year. This year it will be close to a million. Fuel for the first 10 months of 2011 has been $103,000. Last year it was $72,000. We’re paying our bills but there is not a lot left over.” Larrabee with 490 cows is considered one of Maine’s larger dairymen, but he certainly isn’t unique. “Most dairy farms, about 50 percent I think, are just about breaking even,” he said. “The other 50 percent are behind the eight ball.” With the cost of equipment, taxes, feed, veterinary services and infrastructure all jumping higher and higher, Larrabee said, it isn’t right to use the word “profit” when discussing Maine farms. “Most are just holding on.” Bickford said dairy-pricing policy is a hot topic these days in the congressional halls in Washington, DC. “Maine is finally getting some traction and the USDA is listening to the idea that milk should be priced at market value. It should reflect the going rate in competitive regions,” Bickford said. But as long as Maine’s tier program remains in place, there is a future for dairy farming in Maine. Larrabee was encouraged by the support received from Maine consumers. “People in Maine have always spent more on dairy than other parts of the country,” he said. “They want farms. They want the countryside to remain intact. They actively support us.”</p>

Among the factors affecting the cost to produce a pound of milk are feed cost, cow productivity (pounds produced per cow, per day), animal nutrition, genetics, and proper farm maintenance and housing of animals. For example, an increase in feed cost without a corresponding increase in cow milk productivity will squeeze farmer profits. It is not unusual to have milk production costs above the farmer’s selling price. According to Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin, when total milk production costs are above the wholesale price, farmers are forced to take one of a few actions.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_017">Sara Schoenborn, “Stephenson Hopeful, Realistic about 2011 Dairy Outlook,” <em class="emphasis">AG Weekly</em>, January 27, 2011, accessed January 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.agriview.com/news/dairy/stephenson-hopeful-realistic-about-dairy-outlook/article_fc01890d-cfda-5b25-a196-50ab45dbdaa1.html">http://www.agriview.com/news/dairy/stephenson-hopeful-realistic-about-dairy-outlook/article_fc01890d-cfda-5b25-a196-50ab45dbdaa1.html</a>.</span> These actions include the use of genetic engineering (putting <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">human growth hormones</a><span class="glossdef">Growth hormone (GH) is a protein-based polypeptide hormone.

This has been accomplished by installing solar panels, retrofitting the company’s truck fleet, and using advanced rerouting software for its delivery trucks. With these efforts and others, Oakhurst has lowered its annual carbon emissions by more than one thousand metric tons and lowered its operating costs, primarily fuel costs, significantly. In periods of rising and highly volatile oil prices, fuel cost savings have been significant for Oakhurst.

Even Dean Foods, the largest milk processor in the United States, has struggled to pass on price cuts to their raw products suppliers, and this has resulted in significant financial pressure on the milk processors. The recent sharp increase in milk costs has caused dramatic drops in Dean’s profits and stock price.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p07">One controversial strategy to increase productivity and cut costs per gallon of milk is the use of the human growth hormone rBST in cow feed. While the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of rBST in cow feed in 1993, the controversy was far from resolved. Some scientific studies have shown that milk produced this way is safe and has the same amount of proteins, fats, and nutrients as non-hormone-fed cows.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_023">Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is a synthetic version of the bovine somatotropin (BST) hormone found in cattle. The use of rBST has met with some controversy from a variety of fronts, including the animal rights movement and some commercial dairy farmers. As a result, dairies that produce milk products without the use of rBST have begun indicating this on their labels. Though rBST has been banned in several countries, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States has determined it to be safe to consume. See “What Does rBST Free Mean?,” wiseGEEK, accessed March 3, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-rbst-free-mean">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-rbst-free-mean</a>.</span> Other studies contradict these findings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p08">Oakhurst took a firm stand against the use of the hormone rBST in cow feed. In 1997, Stanley Bennett asked its farmers to sign an affidavit pledging not to use human growth hormone. In return they received financial incentives, and shortly after, Oakhurst began marketing its milk as free of the human hormone rBST. In 2003, Monsanto, the largest manufacturer of rBST, sued Oakhurst claiming that Oakhurst’s labels deceived consumers by marketing a perception that one milk product is safer or of higher quality than other milk. At the time of the suit, Monsanto’s worldwide sales revenue from rBST was $4.7 billion. Stanley Bennett countered that Oakhurst made no claim on the science involved with growth hormones.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_024">Drew Kaplan, “Monsanto Sues Oakhurst Dairy over Advertising,” Health Freedom Alliance, June 18, 2010, accessed February 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://healthfreedoms.org/2010/06/18/monsanto-sues-oakhurst-dairy-over-advertising">http://healthfreedoms.org/2010/06/18/monsanto-sues-oakhurst-dairy-over-advertising</a>.</span> He stated, “We’re in the business of marketing milk, not Monsanto’s drugs.” After an intense legal battle, Oakhurst settled the suit. Bill Bennett recalled, “Although the fight with Monsanto was expensive, Stanley Bennett didn’t waver. Stanley was very proud of our stand with Monsanto.

Sixty years later, about twenty-five dairies were operating in Portland. Today, only a few dairies remain in Portland and in New England, and the few that remain are the survivors of consolidation that has swept the dairy industry nationwide. The Bennetts have differentiated their company by making caring for the environment a core value and defining component of the Oakhurst brand. With a strategy of Maine-centric branding, operating efficiencies, and a deep commitment to the environment the company has carved out a market niche that has helped the small dairy processor survive against dairy processors and retailers many times larger.</p>

It owns three additional distribution facilities in Maine, one in New Hampshire, and one in Massachusetts. Every day approximately ten 7,500-gallon tanker trucks deliver raw milk to Oakhurst’s 65,000-square-foot processing plant in Portland, Maine. And every day between 130,000 and 150,000 gallons of milk are processed. The milk comes from eighty farms throughout Maine and northern New England. Many of these farms are family owned and operated and sell their milk exclusively to Oakhurst.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_032">J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">In 2010, Oakhurst processed approximately twenty-two million gallons of fluid milk per year in addition to other dairy products and beverages.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_033">Elaine Pofeldt, “Oakhurst Dairy,” Center for Small Business and the Environment, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf">http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf</a>.</span> At twenty-two million gallons of fluid milk per year, Oakhurst emits approximately a little under sixty-six million pounds, or thirty thousand metric tons, of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>e) annually. A metric ton is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds. Oakhurst used an estimated 27,500 million BTUs in milk production, packaging, and transporting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">Oakhurst samples the milk from each farm, each tanker is tested for antibiotics, and upon completion of the testing, the milk is off-loaded into raw milk storage silos. From the silos, the milk is piped to the processing area where it is separated to the proper level of butterfat. Fluid milk products are then homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified with vitamins. The product is piped into pasteurized tanks from which it is sent to filling machines in the packaging area. Cultured products like buttermilk or sour cream are standardized to the proper fat level and then sent to a cultured tank, where they are held until the culturing process is complete. After completion of the culturing process, the product is sent to another filler in the packaging area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">Eight packaging machines controlled by a computer system direct the products through a network of valves and stainless steel pipes so that each product gets to the proper filler at the right time. Each packaging machine fills a different size or style package. Quality testing is conducted every step of the way through the processing and packaging areas. Oakhurst was one of the first dairy processors to voluntarily adopt the most modern and rigorous set of federal quality standards known as HACCP (Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Points) and is one of only twelve dairies in the country currently implementing these exacting quality standards. After filling, each product is cased and moved to refrigerated warehouses where it is put away for storage until shipped to customers. In warehouse locations and on trucks, the temperature is constantly monitored to ensure the product’s quality.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_034">“Home Page,” Oakhurst Dairy, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.oakhurstdairy.com">http://www.oakhurstdairy.com</a>; J.

In addition to partnering with CA–CP, Oakhurst hired a sustainability consultant to work with the senior managers to examine Oakhurst’s social and environmental practices and to design organization change tactics to improve those practices. The consultant worked with the Bennett family to help transform and inspire employees to adopt and integrate sustainability practices into Oakhurst’s operational culture. As part of this effort, internal teams were established to help bring sustainability to the forefront of Oakhurst Dairy’s culture. These teams helped to establish and manage sustainability efforts including calculating carbon footprint, setting and tracking reductions, reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project and Maine’s governor’s challenge. As part of the continuing training program, Oakhurst hired another consultant to help them draft a code of ethics and respect in the workplace.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">While meeting its 2010 carbon reduction goals and still growing in sales and profits, 2011 looked to be another challenging year for the Bennett family. The death of Stanley Bennett, the rising cost of energy, and the sluggish US economy were presenting challenges for Oakhurst. According to Bill Bennett, competition is tough, and margins are thin; with fuel prices rising rapidly, 2011 will be a difficult year.<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_056">J. Hemmerdinger, “Maine in a Bottle: Oakhurst Dairy Homogenizes Its Marketing Message,” <em class="emphasis">Portland (ME) Press Herald</em>, January 9, 2011, accessed January 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html">http://www.pressherald.com/business/maine-in-a-bottle_2011-01-09.html</a>.</span> Government-set milk prices had been less than the cost of milk production for a couple of years. Many farmers had to make ends meet by selling hay, crops, or livestock for beef and blamed producers, including Oakhurst, for low prices. While Bill Bennett reflected that the “gripes against Oakhurst aren’t fair…the company pays at least market rates and even pays incentives to farmers who keep clean operations and take extra steps to minimize livestock overcrowding and milk contamination.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_057">J.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">Oakhurst believed that its energy reduction and other sustainability programs had been successful, having an impact on reducing its carbon footprint while improving overall company profits. But the company wanted to do more. Bill Bennett highlighted how “the biggest single impact of dairy on the environment is not the energy we use at the plant but methane gas, over 75 percent released from the cows,”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_058">Elaine Pofeldt, “Oakhurst Dairy,” Center for Small Business and the Environment, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf">http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf</a>.</span> Bennett and his team were encouraging their suppliers to start using methane digesters that harvest the energy in cow manure, but none have been able to invest in the technology yet. Bennett was also investigating feed additives designed to improve cows’ digestion, noting that “doing the right thing environmentally is always the right thing for your bottom line.”<span class="footnote" id="gittell_1.0-fn08_059">Elaine Pofeldt, “Oakhurst Dairy,” Center for Small Business and the Environment, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf">http://www.aboutcsbe.org/docs/oakhurstdairy.pdf</a>.</span></p>

        <span class="blockquote" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">Jerry and Linda Jennissen’s 140-cow herd in Minnesota is industrious, pumping out around 1,100 gallons of milk per day. But that’s not the only thing they’re producing. The 3,500 gallons of manure Jennissen’s animals leave behind turns out to be an asset of comparable value when it is converted into power through an anaerobic digester.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p04">The technology first came to the Jennissen’s farm through a grant from the Minnesota Project, a program that encourages sustainable and profitable farming. The project hoped to partner with a mid- to small-sized farm to find the technology to make a digester work financially. Digesters have proven effective on farms with more than 300 cows, but approximately 96 percent of Minnesota dairies have between 50 and 200 cows.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p05">“Digester technology is evolving fairly rapidly, and it needs to,” Jerry Jennissen says. “We viewed it as an opportunity, and we believe that we can make it work.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p06">By partnering with a nearby processor to add whey to the mix, the Jennissens hope to double gas production.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p07">The digester extracts methane gas from the manure and converts it into power, which is used to run a generator. The electricity is sold on a grid. The remaining solids are separated out and used as bedding, and remaining liquids are used for fertilizer. Jennissen believes it is only a matter of time before technology like this comes to farms of all sizes.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p08">“Things are changing so rapidly. Our digester was the third one in the state of Minnesota,” Jennissen says. “There are five now, one year later. I know of several more that are currently operating or in the planning stages.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gittell_1.0-ch08_s05_p09">In announcing plans to celebrate the company’s ninetieth year in business, Bill Bennett stated, “Our story is of one of growth, innovation, service and success. We have been able to remain family-owned and independent while competing against dairies significantly larger than we are because we have a strong brand identity and people know what we stand for and that they can count on us to deliver a high-quality product.” By striving to protect and enhance “the natural goodness of Maine” through its sustainability strategies and community practices, Oakhurst has enhanced its profitability and gained a competitive advantage, a competitive advantage built on creating customer value that competitors find difficult to match. Still Bill Bennett faced many challenges as he planned for the future. While Oakhurst’s opportunities and challenges with its upstream partners (milk suppliers or farmers) align with Oakhurst’s previous strategic commitment to sustainability, can Oakhurst make this happen in the future? What are the possible tradeoffs in doing this with Oakhurst’s suppliers and partners? Can Oakhurst continue to capitalize on its brand of promoting “the natural goodness of Maine” when milk prices are squeezing farmer profits and forcing some out of business?</p>

            <li>What challenges face Oakhurst in 2011 and beyond? How do Oakhurst’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions through operation changes help address the challenges?</li>
            <li>How can your college or university lower its operating costs through sustainability efforts? If your school or college does not know their carbon footprint, suggest the Clean Air–Cool Planet (CA–CP) webpage (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/toolkit/inv-calculator.php">http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/toolkit/inv-calculator.php</a>) to an administrator and consider downloading their carbon footprint calculator.</li>
            <li>The Natural Resources Defense Council’s November 2007 Report (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nrdc.org/policy">http://www.nrdc.org/policy</a>) stated, “Although there are some exceptions, in most cases, locally produced food proves the best choice for minimizing global warming and other pollutants. In fact, another study showed that when you combined all locally grown food, it still produced less carbon dioxide emissions in transport than any one imported product. The effects all this pollution can have on our health may be reflected in high rates of asthma and other respiratory symptoms, as well as increased school absence days for children.” How does Oakhurst’s sustainable business model help to support the Natural Resources Defense Council’s findings that buying local not only helps Maine farmers but also helps the environment?</li>
